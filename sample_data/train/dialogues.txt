parents of kids with add/people with add, what did you do to help with focus in the classroom, that didn't involve medication? __eou__ Fiddle with something in my hands. Just in a non-distracting manner for the other students. __eou__ at what age? __eou__ I was in first grade when I started playing with pens. Due to the school I went to, "There are NO kids with learning disabilities, just kids that don't put in effort" and those who "didn't put in effort" got kicked out. I wasn't actually diagnosed until college. I also saw an article that playing with a soft ball, just moving it from one hand to the other, helps kids with attention issues. It does stop you from taking notes though __eou__ I have some learning disabilities myself. I was not diagnosed until my last year of high school... School was literally hell for me. my son is in first grade, and he is struggling the same way I was. I don't want his school experience to be as miserable as mine was. I am going to get him a fidget box to try at home while doing his homework. to see if that helps him focus at all. __eou__ If homework involves reading, have him read the assignment out loud. I found that helps with understanding a lot. It may be hearing it, or the extra processing, and while I absolutely hated my tutor for making me read the miracle worker out loud between 5th and 6th grade, i went from being 3 grades behind to 2 grades ahead in reading over one summer. Then again, that tutor bribed me to do my work with top ramen. I was so easy to bribe. Since he is in first grade, I'd start with reading out loud to him while he follows along, then have him read the same passage back. This will help with his reading comprehension, if that is his issue. If his issue is that he's bored and knows it already, that's another kettle of fish. Now I am a statistician, so I like to think i'm decent at math, but I was pretty slow there in grade school too. It took a LOT of repetition to get the basics down. But the later stuff, like algebra was much easier when it was re-framed to me as if it was a new language, there are multiple ways to say something, same with Algebra, there are multiple ways to solve an equation. Knowing that helped. Since repetition is one of the only things that worked for me, try to make it fun. I used a lot of the "Super Solver's" video games as a kid too. Apparently that series has been renamed to "leap ahead" __eou__ he gets overwhelmed. like he's good at math, if he is given a page with 10-20 problems it takes him a couple of minutes to get them done, but if you give him a page with 100 problems on it, he shuts down, cannot do it. even if we try to cover it up, have him do one line at a time, etc, just knowing there are 100 problems do to he shuts down. He can read, and reads well on his own terms, but when he is asked to read, won't do it. He also gets distracted super easy, so if he's doing homework, and somebody is making noise in another room, he cannot focus on his homework, and has to check out the noise, that kind of thing. he has 0 ability/desire/ whatever to focus on one task for more than the briefest of moments. He also has horrific hand writing, but i don't know if that is from lack of ability, like me, or if he just doesn't care enough to write correctly. __eou__ I found listening to music, my favorite type of the day, was helpful with distractions. Made it harder to hear things going on in the other room. I'm still very distractable and have to use noise canceling head phones at work if I don't want to be distracted by every conversation in the room. With the not focusing for more than a brief time, try letting him multi-task. So have all of the assignments he needs to do and let him cycle through as his focus shifts. Also since he is young, let him have a 5 minute break for every 15 to 20 minutes of work. As he gets older, extend the work time until he's doing 60 minutes of work and 10 minutes of break time. Having him do something physical just before working helps calm the mind down a bit as well. Maybe try teaching him to juggle and having him juggle on his work break. If he doesn't like juggling, try something he thinks is interesting. Hacky sack is another good low space physical activity too. I have horrific hand writing too, it's a sign of impatients for writing. Neat writing takes longer. __eou__

What should kids be taught at school in 2017? __eou__ How to pay taxes, invest in the stock market, prepare a roth ira, set up direct deposits etc. They should also learn about how to teach themselves. In highschool, I learned to stop thinking and start blindly obeying orders wothout asking any questions. inb4: "how?" Use broken/obsolete computers, cars and other electronics from the community and let the students tinker with them. For everything else (history, science, math and so on) give them real-life problems that aren't just paper/pencil crap. Let them actually choose to learn the topic, by showing them how their knowledge would be useful outside of school. If the lesson wouldn't be useful outside of school, then stop teaching it entirely. Enough of this "the parents should teach **this**, while we teach **that**" bullshit. Either it is a public education or it is not. tl;dr - Teach the students useful information for a change and let the kids actually see how that knowledge can relate to reality, so they can choose to learn it. __eou__

[Serious] Do you think there is a difference between bigotry towards scientology and bigotry towards other religions? Why or why not? __eou__ It all seems the same to me. A general revulsion to the ideas that other people believe. __eou__

[Serious] Do you think there is a difference between bigotry towards scientology and bigotry towards other religions? Why or why not? __eou__ The stated goal of Scientology, to separate people from their wealth, is a little different from real religions. __eou__ How? Churches run exclusively on donations. __eou__ I didn't suggest otherwise. __eou__

[Serious] Do you think there is a difference between bigotry towards scientology and bigotry towards other religions? Why or why not? __eou__ You're allowed to say people of a certain religion do X and you don't approve of that. Crossing the line is saying "no Jews or dogs allowed". Discriminatory policies. In the United States, no religion is outlawed, however horrendously their adherents behave. This is what you Trump people don't get. You've just found out about this backward religion and you're totally onboard with all the fear-mongering they feed you, but you don't for a second think about why this is a matter the government or president has to concern themselves with? They figure if they bury you in statistics of rape and mayhem they can sneak by policies of religious discrimination that fly in the face of the founding principles of our country. They get you whipped up in a frenzy to do *something* but the action they've chosen for you helps nobody. I get what you're driving at, Scientology is notorious for their practices of torture, fraud, federal government infiltration. Therefore, why not pick on Islam, therefore why not make religious discrimination a new principle in our country? It doesn't flow like you want it to. Many religions have problems but bigotry isn't a solution. We're not in disagreement that there are problems, it's the solution we disagree over. Scientology is a problem for which the government can't have a solution, thanks to our precious bill of rights, other than enforcing laws on the books. Such is the sad truth of all religion. I'd like nothing more if we could flip a switch unilaterally ban every faith but the world doesn't work like that. __eou__
[Serious] Do you think there is a difference between bigotry towards scientology and bigotry towards other religions? Why or why not? __eou__ I do not. All strong beliefs have an equal chance of being grossly incorrect. __eou__

[Serious] Have you ever run away from home? How did it go? __eou__ [removed] __eou__
[Serious] Have you ever run away from home? How did it go? __eou__ I ran away from home as a teenager in the early 90s. It was rad. We went camping and sold weed in New Orleans. We were crashing in the 9th Ward before Katrina. I never went back to see if our old mansion was still there. Saw a lot of crack being smoked. Got picked up by gay guys for the first time. That really opened my eyes to gay people, since I hadn't met one growing up. The worst thing about running away is getting busted by the cops and being robbed by other people. Its a good way to learn about human nature. __eou__

If you could live in any time period, when would it be and why? __eou__ Post-Edwardian -- roughly the 1880's to the 1920's. A civilization on the brink of becoming truly a global community, when travel is, for the first time, affordable and fast. Communication over long distances is a new thing, and medicine has caught up enough to where life isn't as awful as it once was. Definitely some downsides, but the culture, the art, the romantics of it just fascinate me. __eou__

Reddit, what's the worst hotel you have ever stayed at and why? __eou__ The worst place I ever had to clean (I was a housekeeper for many years) was probably the clearly used as a sex party house. I mean clearly because there were condoms strewn about the whole house (I cleaned AIRBNB homes for a while), a bottle of lube just laying in the kitchen, and a few random dildos around. The worst hotel I ever stayed at was the Motel 6 in San Fran. I found hair everywhere and a sock in our bed. The only good part about it was that the room still smelled like the weed the housekeepers must have smoked in there. Which is the exact note I left on the comment card the next morning. We also kept hearing car doors opening and closing, pretty sure it was a regular place for prostitutes and drug dealers to hang out. __eou__
Reddit, what's the worst hotel you have ever stayed at and why? __eou__ I stayed at one of the nicest hotels in Minsk, Belarus. Still had cockroaches everywhere. Ugh, was the worst.

Reddit, what's the worst hotel you have ever stayed at and why? __eou__ had period sex at a premiere inn and left some blood on the sheets (sorry), came back the next evening and it looked like they'd replaced the sheets but they'd just flipped them over. Also I left like a quarter of a cup of tea on the side when I left in the morning and they'd left it there, but maybe they thought I was saving it because I liked really cold tea? __eou__

Literally everyone was staring, my dad got embarrassed, we got kicked out and he swore to never take us out to a restaurant ever again. __eou__ A bowl of oysters? Like, just sitting out for anything or anyone to grab? That's even more disgusting. __eou__ Yeah.

[Serious]How did you find Jesus? __eou__ Since you need a serious answer Ill give what I can. I don't have any real denomination or "practice" but I believe in Christ and what he taught. Most of my "faith" is through personal experiences and accounts from people I hold very dearly or highly. I wasn't raised all too religious, with my parents being separated and my mother (my guardian parent) and her family weren't religious at all. My father's family on the other hand was moderately religious, with it mostly being my grandmother and father, but it was never pushed on me. To go through Communion was of my own volition out of curiosity more than anything, but it was not at all well presented to me. Not only was the church atmosphere rather "creepy", the bible studies did not offer much knowledge into the faith. Nonetheless I made communion but never went on to confirmation (Catholic). I always had a lingering "faithfulness" that was towards some higher power but I didn't belong to a church and still don't. I started believing specifically in Christ fully as I have had my prayers answered several times after I had started around 12 (my dog was terminally ill and had a 12% chance of survival, I prayed to Christ and my dog is still alive today at age 14 and still like a pup) and have had plenty of close calls with death that I saw as Divine-Intervention-ish moments. My father has as well, and as recently just started talking about all the times that he believes God was watching over him. Furthermore, from a historical standpoint I see that there are too many "coincidences" and points of possible Divine-Intervention; though I don't believe God is too interventionist, there are plenty of times he seems to decide its necessary. I'm pretty busy and have to get Mandarin homework done, so it's probably not the most indepth answer you're looking for but its better than what Ive seen on here. __eou__

Redditors who live in a small town (5,000 people or less) what businesses (chain or independent) have managed to make it? __eou__ I don't have an answer for this, but it's a great question. __eou__
Redditors who live in a small town (5,000 people or less) what businesses (chain or independent) have managed to make it? __eou__ Pizza Hut, and a little mom and pop shop called the little market deli I don't live there anymore just went to high school there and I go back every so often to see my mom Edit: population about 2200 __eou__
Redditors who live in a small town (5,000 people or less) what businesses (chain or independent) have managed to make it? __eou__ Dollar stores. Dollar stores everywhere. __eou__ Yup, Dollar General specifically in my area. __eou__
Redditors who live in a small town (5,000 people or less) what businesses (chain or independent) have managed to make it? __eou__ The population of the town where my parents are from is less than 2,000. There is one corner store there that also serves as a pharmacy. They mix their own medications which is pretty rare now which helps to draw some business. It's pretty impressive they're still open as every other business in town has shut down __eou__
Redditors who live in a small town (5,000 people or less) what businesses (chain or independent) have managed to make it? __eou__ Mcds __eou__

Redditors who live in a small town (5,000 people or less) what businesses (chain or independent) have managed to make it? __eou__ Seriously love this question. Brick and mortar businesses actually in my town: * Pizza/Italian restaurant (new england) * Tractor Supply (for life out here™?) * A Volkswagen specialist who is so good people drive from other states to have him work on their Beetles and busses. * Oddly enough our movie theater reopened recently and seems to be doing ok. * The local vet * Subway sandwich place (gross) * Furniture maker of some sort? * New England "Inn" style restaurant * Ford dealer * Self storage * I think an old general store but I've never been there. We've had a convenient store that closed and opened a few times with new owners, so I won't call that successful. Brick and mortar businesses in our sister town (very short drive right over the border, slightly larger population though) * Dunkin Donuts * Incredible poultry/pork farm with an awesome self serve farm stand (pay with PayPal!) That even offers premade refrigerated food (pasta, raviolis, soup, pot pies, etc) * Small dive bar/restaurant * Another pizza place * Small salon * Some fancy "tea room"? * More restaurants * Consignment/antiques/cute stuff shop For non brick and mortar in the area : * Farms * Electricians/Landscapers/Plumbers etc __eou__
Redditors who live in a small town (5,000 people or less) what businesses (chain or independent) have managed to make it? __eou__ I lived in a town of about 6 thousand, so a little larger , but still relatively small. We had 4 hotels, about a dozen and a half fast food places and 4 gas stations. 95% of this can be attributed to the amount of through traffic we got, and the prevalence of the oil industry in the area. __eou__
Redditors who live in a small town (5,000 people or less) what businesses (chain or independent) have managed to make it? __eou__ McDonald's and a little drive-in diner called Maid-Rite. __eou__
Redditors who live in a small town (5,000 people or less) what businesses (chain or independent) have managed to make it? __eou__ The local auto parts store, which is odd because we also have an O'Riley, Nappa, and an AutoZone as well. I don't know how we support that many car parts stores but we do. __eou__
Redditors who live in a small town (5,000 people or less) what businesses (chain or independent) have managed to make it? __eou__ Bars. . We have a few that have changed ownership but the bars always pull through. __eou__

What's the worst food you've ordered but didn't send back? __eou__ I ordered a tenderloin steak medium rare and it came well done. I didn't want to be a burden to the staff so I just accepted my leather shoe while shedding tears inside __eou__ I remember a lesson teaching people how to tell the difference when cooking meat. Touch your finger to the muscle below your thumb. Index finger is rare Middle is medium rare Ring is Medium Pinky is well done __eou__
What's the worst food you've ordered but didn't send back? __eou__ I ordered something I really thought I'd like, but ended up absolutely hating it. I ordered it in earnest and since the cook or server wasn't the one who messed up I felt bad when I thought to return it. The waitress found out ('cause I only ate like 1/3 of the plate) and felt bad that I didn't say anything. She gave me a free dessert though LoL __eou__ Do you recall what it was? __eou__ I'm pretty sure it was Philly Cheese Steak...99% sure that's what it was. :) __eou__ Green peppers and onions can be quite a strong flavor if you're not already accustom to it. __eou__ I eat green peppers and onion fairly regularly in sauces and stews and such. __eou__ I think in sauces or stews their flavor is diluted but in a philly there's no masking the flavor. You're getting the full brunt of it. __eou__
What's the worst food you've ordered but didn't send back? __eou__ I ordered a cheeseburger at Carl's Jr. once and they forgot the cheese. I took it back and two seconds later they gave it back with a cold, unmelted slice of American cheese on it. I didn't wanna try my luck after that. __eou__ Not quite what I was after but yes that tends to be the case with people. One bad experience can be that missed opportunity for a returning customer. Or more if word of mouth is working against you. __eou__
What's the worst food you've ordered but didn't send back? __eou__ I ordered some food at a Eastern European spot in nyc. They brought out the food which was awful. We didn't send it back bc we snuck outta the restaurant. __eou__ What made it awful? __eou__ Smelled like stale farts __eou__
What's the worst food you've ordered but didn't send back? __eou__ I never send back food unless it's raw or missing something. __eou__
What do you tell yourself to motivate you to get things done? __eou__ [removed] __eou__ god damn __eou__
What do you tell yourself to motivate you to get things done? __eou__ Eating the crust of a sandwich or pizza. I have to tell myself that there are people starving in the world and I have to eat EVERYTHING off of my plate. __eou__
What do you tell yourself to motivate you to get things done? __eou__ Lately I've been telling myself that I am a *WARRIOR*, and warriors continue doing shit even if it's extremely difficult or they have to force themselves to continue. I know that sounds super cringey but it's just what works for me at the moment. I have severe, treatment-resistant depression, so that motivational speech will probably stop working soon and I'll have to find something else. Edit: It's also what I tell myself when doing the world's lamest exercises, such as marching in place while doing windmills with my arms and watching Netflix for 20 minutes every night so that I get my heartrate up in a manageable way. It helps with depression, according to my psychiatrist. __eou__
What do you tell yourself to motivate you to get things done? __eou__ I had not realized that was an option. __eou__

[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ can we go back to a time where bringing up politics at work was taboo? __eou__ Oh yes please. Cassie, I don't give a fuck about how you "love America and it makes your soul cry to see it divided" I really don't care. __eou__ and when you don't wanna talk about it they just assume you have the opposite opinion and must be the enemy No, I just have a job to do and recognize that this conversation would disrupt us as a team because some people get emotional. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ can we go back to a time where bringing up politics at work was taboo? __eou__ Yes. Also religion. Please. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Bragging about getting laid. Completely arrogant and stupid behavior __eou__ Disrespectful to your partner too. If you just see her as an achievement your stepping stone or something you could at least keep it to yourself. __eou__ I feel it brings about this pressure on lame dudes to get laid frequently. Maybe leading to forceful sexual behavior? __eou__ I wouldn't call it "forced". You need to be at least a little predisposed to that type of decision making to let peer pressure get to you in that way. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Bragging about getting laid. Completely arrogant and stupid behavior __eou__ Or just sharing really personal details about your sex life with people, which'll embarrass the person you're sleeping with. Talking about yourself is fine, but I think it's disrespectful to, for example, tell everyone about the size of your partner's penis. Or even worse, show your friends pictures. Why do people even do that? __eou__ I went for an assessment centre type interview a few years back. At lunch three or four of us candidates where sat round a table talking and somehow two of the guys ended up pulling out their phones to show videos of them having sex with their partners! It was insane, in the middle of an interview day, fuck knows how the conversation got to that point. I was just in a daze after. Honestly it knocked me off life, i felt queasy for the rest of the afternoon's exercises. __eou__ Just...what? If any guy I was with showed their buddy a video of me having sex with them they'd be a fucking goner. Some people just really have no shame. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Staring at phones when with friends __eou__ This. Especially when you're at a restaurant/pub/whatever together. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Staring at phones when with friends __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ Yea a quick text or whatever is fine. But staring at your phone when I'm trying to make an effort to have a conversation kills me. Stupid fucking phones. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Staring at phones when with friends __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ I agree with you. I just hung out with my best friend. We went out to eat and both were cool eith the other texting people, but not the whole time. Just one here or there. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Staring at phones when with friends __eou__ Me and my friends have this thing where if we go out to eat we all stack our phones in the middle and the first one to touch theirs has to pay for everybody. I've gotten so much free beer and food from it cause sometimes without thinking one of us will grab out phone cause we hear a text or something __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ Move to Germany or Switzerland. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ The way dating is nowadays, how so many guys seem to think it's ok to mess a girl around and say they're not "exclusive" for so long because he thinks he might get someone better. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Whining about the election results. __eou__ At this point yes. Marcus Aurelius teaches that the initial reaction and feeling (first week of chaos) are natural and ok but beyond that point you must fence off your mind to such external things that 1. you can't control and 2. probably won't affect you much. Thinking about the election will affect you more than the election will^^^^unless^^^you're^^^an^immigrant. __eou__ Marcus Aurelius was the fucking Imperator dude. Of course he'd say not to freak out over who's in power. __eou__ He'd say to take action if you feel he is dangerous, but he wouldn't advise writing 20 articles on buzzfeed and bitching to every single person you meet. Basically he thinks one should control the meat body and actions with a "remote control" of sorts with the mind just chilling somewhere else so it doesn't get tilted. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Asking someone where and how they live. Sometimes it's not that easy to explain or the person is embarrassed of their situation. __eou__

[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Asking somebody what they do (for work) as one of the first questions about them. You're essentially creating a power-relationship before even getting to know them. __eou__ Ha yeah everything is about money, even socially. __eou__

[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Asking somebody what they do (for work) as one of the first questions about them. You're essentially creating a power-relationship before even getting to know them. __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ Oh, I agree. I honestly didn't think much of it until it came up that my (deceased) grandpa used to say that. And then I really thought about it... and it's true. While people definitely have great stories from work it's usually best to let them bring it up... and then that eliminates the 'I'm unemployed' or the 'well.. I'm *only* a...' type scenarios. If people are happy about what they do, it'll come up naturally by them. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Asking somebody what they do (for work) as one of the first questions about them. You're essentially creating a power-relationship before even getting to know them. __eou__ I live in Hong Kong, and that is one of the first questions anyone asks when you first meet them (massive generalization but you get the idea). Depending on how forward they are it may be followed up with a "oh! So how much do you make?" Culture here has status based around how much you earn and what you do for a living. Its important to some people. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Asking somebody what they do (for work) as one of the first questions about them. You're essentially creating a power-relationship before even getting to know them. __eou__ I used to get this a lot when I said I worked at the local Hospital. Where you were placed in the town's pecking order depended on what job you had at the Hospital. So I used to tell them "I'm a morgue attendant". That soon sorted out the 'real' people from the 'image' people. (My actual job was Head of a Department.) __eou__ Hahaha - that's a good one. Yeah, I guess I just wish people could ask each other about what they did and not turn it into an image thing. I also work in a hospital, and I'm constantly clarifying 'Oh, but I'm not a doctor..' and it's awkward and uncomfortable. It would be better if it just didn't come up. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Smoking, I smoked for 20 years and now 1 month stopped. Let me tell you the craving is least of your worries. I've lost my vision in one eye and have a resting heart rate of a rapsist in clown shoes. I would not wish this on anyone. Ban it now and we might just save some people. Edit: sorry to be a martyr. __eou__ Big think of the *money though~*. What are you some type of *c o m m u n i s t?* __eou__ Give it a year big tabacco will own all marijuana plantations too, if not already, they will never lose like big oil. __eou__ And then we have the cartels shipping a bunch of heroin. I live in New Jersey and do you know how many junkies are just walking the streets with impunity? It was not like this a few years ago. __eou__ I am from a place in Scotland called Greenock. It is famous for having more heroin addicts per head than anywhere else on the globe ( even south america and Thailand ). The junkies wear it like a badge of honor, just out of curiosity have you seen "Train Spotting?" Yeah, and that was nearly 20 years ago, things have not gotten better. __eou__ Hey, at least you guys got trainspotting 2 made __eou__ Yeah, its great to glamourise drugs that destroy lives as a tourism bit for Scotland....Freedom!! __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Alcohol __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Pressuring others into drinking more than they're comfortable with. I saw this a lot in college, but I still see it in people who are old enough to know better. Let people drink however much they want. If you want to take shots, enjoy it with the people who want to join you. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ The absence of tact and class. Not giving a fuck doesn't mean it's okay to be an obnoxious asshole; this ranges from the garden variety shithead to the highest echelons of government. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Having children, especially when you don't have the means to support a family. There is nothing wrong with not wanting to procreate! __eou__ I've decided that if I don't make a certain amount I'm just not going to have kids. I don't have the heart to explain to them how I came from a 1mil+ household and somehow I'm driving them to McDonalds for dinner in a 2019 Honda Odyssey. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Having children, especially when you don't have the means to support a family. There is nothing wrong with not wanting to procreate! __eou__ Yes! I have been a nanny for all ages, I know for a fact that I do not want to have kids. I always get, "but it's different when they are your kids." Guess wht, they are still a time/money sucker. I don't want them. I love them, they are fun to play with, but at the end of the day, I don't want to worry about them all the time. I want to have my space and free time doing whatever the hell I want. Plus my husband and I want to be able to just pick up and go places on a moment's notice. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Giving unsolicited 'advice', especially about something you're not really very expert in, and especially when you're just assuming a low level of knowledge about that thing in the person. It comes in the forms of advice, 'constructive criticism', and correcting. It tends to be people who overestimate their own ability/understanding/expertise and underestimate other people's. They're completely lacking insight into how frequently they're wrong, or [not even wrong](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong). I don't go for defending the person doing it, I'd much rather slip in the back-up that the person being talked-at does actually know their shit/has already tried that very obvious solution *first*. It's this patronising shit that people just seem to be able to get away with socially, under the guise of 'just trying to be helpful'. Other people often defend or try to minimise what they've just witnessed by claiming that the person was 'just trying to be helpful' too. I think that often (not *always*, for anyone who was just about to demonstrate my point for me) the person's main driver isn't really about helping the other person, but about feeling superior, showing off , and diffusing their own contempt and irritation with someone who they perceive/assume to be wrong or ignorant. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Calling women sluts. It's just not a very nice thing to be called, and the word makes me wince a bit. I'm not a huge fan of bitch either, but I don't loathe it as much as slut. __eou__ Slut honestly hurts you more than it does the girl in the eyes of others. Women hate when you call other women sluts. Bitch is only a little better but "cunt" is basically shooting them and walking away scot free. I've never even heard anybody call a woman a cunt in private. __eou__ I hate the word slut so much, I'd much rather be called a cunt tbh. __eou__ Okay, cunt^^^^^^^^^jk^im^a^nice^guy^i^swear __eou__ Me and my friends call each other cunts fairly regularly tbh. We know we're all cunts so it's fine. __eou__ I mean I guy to a guy a girl angrily which would have the most effect. In terms of an offhanded "oh, she's a ****" slut probably is the worst because you're defining her by your perception of her actions. __eou__ Exactly, the word slut just seems so much more gender specific and personal, which is why it would hurt me the most, even if I know for a fact it isn't true. I just don't think anyone of either gender should be shamed for their bedroom choices, whether they want lots of sex and partners, or want to wait for marriage. I suppose in a similar vain, the word 'frigid' is also pretty insulting, although it's not one I've been personally called. __eou__ I've never heard it used with a sexual connotation. I've only used "cold" heard to describe personality. __eou__ I've heard numerous men call women a 'frigid bitch' for not sleeping with them. It's pretty gross. __eou__ Jeez. Guys take sex too seriously honestly. There is so much more to it all. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Calling women sluts. It's just not a very nice thing to be called, and the word makes me wince a bit. I'm not a huge fan of bitch either, but I don't loathe it as much as slut. __eou__ My sister's (now ex) husband called her a whore for years. She cheated on him (he was too, not that it makes her decision right, just saying it to give you perspective) and any time she didn't do something he wanted her to do, he would call her a whore or slut. It was a way to keep her feeling guilty and stay with him. I am so damn happy they are separated now. __eou__ Any man who calls you a whore really isn't worth your time. Any man who calls you any mean name, really. Something I learned way too late. __eou__ Agreed! Same goes for woman. If they are catty and call their significant other names, drop them like a hot potato! __eou__ Exactly, no one should have to deal with verbal abuse. __eou__ Absolutely! It is terrible, and, at times, so difficult to notice. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Sagging pants. Not finishing your food, if you don't plan to finish your food stay at home and cook your own proportions. The amount of food wasted in the restaurant industry is horrible enough without you eating half and not bringing it home. If it taste bad but still edible then eat it and don't go out to eat. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Adults throwing tantrums Just because you didn't get your way doesn't mean you get to scream about it in public while everyone else is uncomfortable. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Cigarettes __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ I'm a fussy eater, and I hate this so fucking much. Just let me be fussy in peace, dammit. __eou__
[Serious] What do you wish were less socially acceptable? __eou__ Looking down upon people who have college education-- basically, I'm taking about the people who reject known experts and would rather remain ignorant. The anti-knowledge/education attitude that we have here in the US. __eou__

His book about life on the Mississippi i did find hard going and took me a few tries to get through Edit: missed a word __eou__
What is the best book you've ever read? __eou__ "Treasure Island" is my all time favorite. Every time I read it I am stunned by some of the [evocative writing](http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=stevenson&amp;book=treasure&amp;story=israel). It's just as good if you find an audiobook version (there are a lot of them) with a good reader. __eou__
What is the best book you've ever read? __eou__ Plato's "Republic". It's mandatory here in Greece but it's by far the best book I have ever read. It's so relevant after two millennia that is unbelievable. __eou__
What is the best book you've ever read? __eou__ 50 shades of grey __eou__
What is the best book you've ever read? __eou__ The Gallic War Definitely not the best but by far the most unique. It's a humble account directly from the battlefield by a man who changed the world. A book like it will most likely never be written again especially since there are no real warrior-politicians, and if there are most of their work is done from behind a desk or video conference. __eou__

What is the best book you've ever read? __eou__ Not a serious read but The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy series is really quirky and made me chuckle. Funny satirical commentary on life, I recommend :) __eou__ You know, I loved the movie, I tried reading the book and just could not get into it. I plan on trying again, but I have other books on my list first. __eou__

What is the best book you've ever read? __eou__ "Bothar mor an tSaoil" is the biography of an Irishman born into poverty in west Donegal in the 19th century. The book charts his life story from his childhood, to travelling to America to seek his fortune, and ultimately he struck gold in the Klondike gold rush. It's an absolutely fascinating book filled with anecdotes and old Irish folklore and it's a real window into the Irish psyche and personality. I make a point of reading it at least once a year. __eou__

What is the best book you've ever read? __eou__ A Thousand Splendid Suns is a great book. __eou__
What is the best book you've ever read? __eou__ Both the Pillars of the Earth and Shantaram __eou__ Oooh! I picked up Shantaram but I felt he dragged for ages in something that could of been written in a couple of sentences. Sucks because I really wanted to read it so I just had my parents tell me the ending. You might enjoy The Bronze Horseman! I've been told to read Pillars of the Earth for years now. __eou__ I'll try it! Shantaram has a lot of long winded prose. It's very flowery writing and definitely not for everyone. __eou__
What is the best book you've ever read? __eou__ The Alchemist. Read it as a student, then again later as an -ahem- adult. Funny how your perspectives change. __eou__

What is the best book you've ever read? __eou__ Moby Dick. A whole lot of people think it's incredibly boring, as I did my first time through. But when given the chance to delve into it, I found that the wording I thought was too verbose to begin with actually painted a picture like nothing I had ever read: "*Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off — then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.*" __eou__
What is the best book you've ever read? __eou__ Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal __eou__
Professionals/interviewers of reddit, what are some interview tips you can offer for someone who's just starting their career? __eou__ Work on that handshake. No one likes a limp wrist. Eye contact and posture is important. So is dress. Look the part, act the part. __eou__
Professionals/interviewers of reddit, what are some interview tips you can offer for someone who's just starting their career? __eou__ Be confident. I know, easier said than done, but it's a frame of mind. Be content with who you are, believe that you are competent, capable and intelligent, walk in, answer questions, shake hands firmly, and don't second guess yourself. Obligatory edit: Be confident, but don't be an ass. __eou__

What thing that is acceptable for a child to have/do, that you wish was still okay for when you are an adult? __eou__ To start off I think I would wish Healies were still okay to use as a young adult, my god those things were so cool and fun to use. Plus the convenience of just rolling along the pavement or smooth surface... :D __eou__ I was too old to experience them as a kid. So jealous :/ __eou__ That's a damn shame! __eou__
What thing that is acceptable for a child to have/do, that you wish was still okay for when you are an adult? __eou__ Bouncy Houses with inflatable pugil sticks __eou__

What's the strangest thing you've ever had to get used to? __eou__ The fact that everyone believes the moon landing was real __eou__ Ikr, it's so fake... __eou__
What's the strangest thing you've ever had to get used to? __eou__ The fact that everyone believes the moon landing was real __eou__ Is this the one NASA claimed to have overwritten the footage of? Because that was one incredibly terrible excuse. __eou__
What's the strangest thing you've ever had to get used to? __eou__ The fact that everyone believes the moon landing was real __eou__ Also they say the earth is round. What? Do they think we're a bunch of idiots? __eou__ Oh I know right? I always tell those people to go stand on the edge of a cliff and tell me if they see a curve on the horizon. "Don't see it? Yeah maybe if you jump you'll notice it." __eou__
What's the strangest thing you've ever had to get used to? __eou__ [removed] __eou__ why are you doing this to me __eou__
What's the strangest thing you've ever had to get used to? __eou__ When my brother died when he was 16 and I was 14. It was like an alternate universe......his room was there with everything in it.....his clothes, his bed, all his "stuff"....his shampoo and soap and stuff still in the bathroom. Dirty clothes still in the hamper.....but he was just gone. It was so horrible and weird. My parents couldn't bring themselves to clean out his room or touch his stuff. So his room became like this time capsule at the end of the hallway. I was the only one who went in there to be able smell him. The room stayed that way for about 3 years untill my Dad and I cleaned it up. I'm 36 now and I still drive around with a bag of his clothes in my car. My mom gave them to me when she cleaned out the shed 2 years ago, I put them in my car, and didnt know what to do with them so they just ride around with me.( I know it's weird lol) So I guess I never got used to it then, huh? __eou__ I'm so sorry to hear about your loss, but that's very sweet of you to keep his stuff around. I hope you're doing better now. __eou__ Thank you. I'm fine, I miss his presence but I know he's still around. 😋Fun fact- my brothers name is Andrew. Between my other brother and I we have 3 sons. They are all named Andrew! They go by their middle names. So I have 2 sons and a nephew with the same name. They like it, they think it's cool they all share the name. It gets confusing at school and the doctors though haha __eou__
What's the strangest thing you've ever had to get used to? __eou__ My current girlfriend actually trusting me, unlike my ex I'd say something like "I bumped into Kathryn earlier" and she'd be ok with it, and in the back of my mind I'd ask "Why aren't you freaking out? Aren't you wondering if she was hitting on my or something?" - that's the kind of shit I had to deal with __eou__
What's the strangest thing you've ever had to get used to? __eou__ The first time a person liked me in a romantic way. About a week into it i had this epiphany on the shitter, a sort of an "out of body" feeling. As i was sitting there I suddenly felt my soul leaving my body and I just looked at myself from the outside and thought "wow, how did this happen? *why* does she even like me". It was a sinking feeling, i was spiraling deeper and deeper in a vortex of jumbled thoughts about this new sensation. A sudden fart brought me back to the plane of reality, the echoing sound and the outburst of gut-wrenching smell swept my soul right back into my body. It was a strange feeling, I was never really lonely but I never really had anyone close to me. It felt very unusual (in a good way) that there was someone who i could talk to about anything. __eou__ You should start writing a book. __eou__

People of Reddit, who do you live for? __eou__ Nobody. If I was more positive, I'd say I live for myself. I don't feel like that's the case, though, really. I feel like I live because I'm not dead. I chose not to drop out of university last year and I chose to keep going and struggle through it all. But I'm doing this because options are hard to find and not because of a fundamental need to do this for myself. I'm trying to keep myself going, but I find that I lack motivation for weeks at a time and don't care about keeping going. I live because I live and do the stuff I do because it's there to do. My biggest fear really is what I'll do when university is gone. Even just for a summer. __eou__ Your worried that you won't have anything to do? Smoke a few bowls, relax... __eou__

When it comes to tortilla chips, what is the best shape and why? Triangle, round, rectangle or those weird cup things? __eou__ Cups, you can easily get enough dip or salsa on your chip, and they don't really drip. __eou__ It's hard to get the edges of the bowl with the cups though __eou__
When it comes to tortilla chips, what is the best shape and why? Triangle, round, rectangle or those weird cup things? __eou__ All depends on what kind of dip you're eating with it __eou__ Interesting. Can you elaborate? __eou__
When it comes to tortilla chips, what is the best shape and why? Triangle, round, rectangle or those weird cup things? __eou__ I like the cups. They tend not to break, they're mouth sized, and they (of course) scoop and hold dips better. __eou__
When it comes to tortilla chips, what is the best shape and why? Triangle, round, rectangle or those weird cup things? __eou__ usually the cups, but triangle with salsa. mostly because i don't like to actually eat the salsa i just get the juice off of it __eou__ I think I like round. It's efficient at getting the edges and can hold an easy increased volume over the triangle. I have a coworker who will argue for the rectangle based on strength and volume. __eou__

Former Assholes of Reddit, why were you an asshole and why did you change? __eou__ I was a bully and homophobic in middle school. I changed after attending a performing arts school. Socializing with LGBT individuals made me realize what a dumbass I was __eou__

What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Forrest Gump and The Bodyguard __eou__ damn, didn't know about the bodyguard. forrest gump is a good call tho. most people miss that one. also you missed godfather and ordinary people. __eou__ Never read The Godfather or Ordinary People...I think the Bodyguard was written after the movie though...I saw the movie first and read the book that had the movie poster as the cover...but I was a kid so I don't honestly remember __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Forrest Gump and The Bodyguard __eou__ damn, didn't know about the bodyguard. forrest gump is a good call tho. most people miss that one. also you missed godfather and ordinary people. __eou__ I don't know man, Godfather was an amazing book. It fleshed out on all of its characters, even the minor ones. You get a Luca Brasi POV, which he was completely nerfed in the movie. Then you have Michael's super detailed slow transition from being a war hero to a mafioso. I also loved the part where it fleshed out why Sonny wouldn't make it as a don because of his personality and why Hagen wasn't consider a good war time consigliere. __eou__ Plus you get lots of details about Lucy Mancini's giant vag. __eou__ The oddest subplot in the history of subplots. __eou__ The thing is, I actually quite like the Lucy Mancini subplot. I mean, at its heart *The Godfather* is a family saga, and family sagas are never exactly what you'd call linear. It's a sprawling epic that deals with the major issues of the Corleones and the lives of those who surround them, and it's kind of nice that even a character as seemingly minor as Lucy gets a happy ending. Plus let's not forget the fact that Luca Brasi straight-up throws a baby into a furnace at one point. That's a thing that happens. __eou__ Actually if I recall correctly it was the plastic surgeon that got the happy ending.... __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Forrest Gump and The Bodyguard __eou__ damn, didn't know about the bodyguard. forrest gump is a good call tho. most people miss that one. also you missed godfather and ordinary people. __eou__ I don't know man, Godfather was an amazing book.

What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Forrest Gump and The Bodyguard __eou__ Never watched that film. __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Forrest Gump and The Bodyguard __eou__ Good call on Gump. The movie is about a dimwitted guy who makes it through with hard work and honesty. The movie is a wild story about an autistic savant who becomes an astronaut, folk singer, is stranded on an island full of cannibals with a chimp, and becomes a chess-master, among other absurdities. __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Forrest Gump and The Bodyguard __eou__ Forrest Gump was one of the least enjoyable books I've ever read. Movie is top 5 most enjoyable. __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ How to Train Your Dragon __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Shawshank Redemption __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Interesting question. When the movie is better than the book, we don't really hear much about the book. Didn't know Forrest Gump was a book so can't comment on it with authority, but the movie was darn good. Actually, that's all I can think of right now. __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Fantastic Beasts __eou__ Yes! Especially considering that the book was like five pages long and didn't really have anything about Newt. It was essentially an encyclopedia. __eou__ Well wasn't the book supposed to be like the textbook? __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Definitely Blade Runner. The movie wrestled with all this moral ambiguity: what makes a human? The book lacked any of this. Replicants are evil. End of story. __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ the last two hunger games are better than the 3rd book __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Fight Club __eou__ Oooh I don't know man the book was pretty great __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ The Godfather, Jaws, Die Hard, The Silence of the Lambs, Goodfellas, No Country for Old Men. __eou__

What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Fightclub! __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Moby Dick. The book is horrendous, and I'm convinced Melville was commissioned to 'write' the thing by the league of evil grade 11 teachers. __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ The Princess Bride, although that's kind of cheating as the author not only wrote the screenplay but bought back the movie rights before the film was made. __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ The Godfather. The book has some great ideas and elements, but is also long-winded with too many subplots (including one particularly egregious one about Sonny's mistress getting her vagina enlarged so she can have sex with him, as Sonny has an abnormally large penis) The movie cuts out all the bullshit, and leaves the best parts of the book intact. And it is all the better for it. __eou__ She's not getting her vagina enlarged. She has a naturally 'oversized' vagina, to the extent that nothing but Sonny's giant wang can satisfy her. She just happens to meet a plastic surgeon who proceeds to make her vagina all nice and tight again, so she can live happily ever after. You know. That old chestnut. __eou__ Ah, it appears I had it backwards! Probably because I'd like to erase that part from my memory. Thanks for the correction! __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Beautiful Creatures. I didn't expect to like the movie and ended up loving it. Read the book and wasn't super impressed. I hope they make more movies, because I've read two or three of the books and I am growing less interested. __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Thank you for smoking. The books ending sucks and the kid just disappears like half way through the book. __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ lord of the rings, i'd say. the books are still great but they're a tough read at first __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ i, robot __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Fight Club, at least the author thinks so. __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ *Who Censored Roger Rabbit*. It's so bad, in fact, that in the sequel novel (*Who P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit?*) the events of the first book are played off as just a bad dream that Jessica Rabbit had, and everything follows on from the film version. __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Where Babies Come From __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Lord of the rings despite that i havent read the books yet __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Absolute Power, Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman. The screenplay cut probably 2/3rds of the book, the completely superfluous parts. __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ Stardust __eou__
What movie is better than its book counterpart? __eou__ I've heard that even Stephen King thought "The Shining" was a better movie than it was a book. __eou__
Users of reddit, what's the biggest "I'm better than the rest of the world" national flag? __eou__ 'Murican flag it is __eou__
Users of reddit, what's the biggest "I'm better than the rest of the world" national flag? __eou__ The Manx flag, nothing says "I'm better than you" than flaunting that you have three legs. http://imgur.com/a/7KM74 __eou__
Users of reddit, what's the biggest "I'm better than the rest of the world" national flag? __eou__ For sure Nepal (https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-45d6d0b9d5775587ab27f6f7d856a98c-c) I mean, a few other countries have squares instead of rectangles, but nobody else felt entitled to change the whole flag game from the ground up like this edgy pice of work. __eou__

[Serious] What is the scariest thing going on in your life right now? __eou__ Trying to decide what I want to do as a career...I'm 23 __eou__ I didn't start training for my current career (pilot) until I was 25. Didn't start working in my field until I was 29. Now 33 with a fantastic career that I love. At 23, you have plenty of time to decide. Just make sure every day you do at least one thing for your future self. Even if it's just putting $20 in your savings account for school, or training, or an emergency. __eou__

[Serious] What is the scariest thing going on in your life right now? __eou__ My husband's mother's family ALL have had cancer. His mom, his aunts, his grandmother, and his cousins. Watching them have to deal with Chemo and then radiation... GAH its rough. I am feeling like I am married to a ticking time bomb sometimes... jUst a matter of when. I mean if it happens, we'll get through it. But it's nerve-wracking to think about it too much. The upside is that everyone has survived it (so far) __eou__ Does he get regular screenings? __eou__ He's a vet so he uses the VA. He gets an annual physical (typical blood draw and screenings), but they don't do the specialized full body cancer scans __eou__
[Serious] What is the scariest thing going on in your life right now? __eou__ Not to be a downer but I've got a revolver and a .44 mag bullet with me. Scary thoughts are going through my head right now. __eou__ Get rid of the bullets. Throw them somewhere irretrievable. Talk it out. There are plenty of people willing to talk. Myself included. __eou__ Talk is cheap. All people do is talk and say things that aren't necessarily true. It'll get better blah blah. Sometimes it doesn't. __eou__ Guy from Liverpool living in Spain willing to talk too if you need it. Quite lonely living in Spain away from my family __eou__ Thanks but I don't see the point honestly. __eou__

Welcome to your new, independent, commitment-free life where you can focus on yourself for a while :) __eou__

What is the biggest risk you have taken? Did it pan out? __eou__ It panned out when I panned their face against a stove. __eou__
What is the biggest risk you have taken? Did it pan out? __eou__ I left a city job as a design engineer with one of the world's biggest consumer electronics companies. After 12 years, I wanted a different life for my kids and my family. We moved away from the city, family, and friends to start over. We moved to a small ski town where we get to sit by a fire pit and watch the stars at night. Did it pan out? Absolutely. Although I only make 50% of what I used to, the cost of living is only about 40% of what the city was. Even though I took a huge pay cut, it turns out I got a raise. My kids are skiing, rock climbing, mountain biking, fishing, and exploring mountain lakes. I used to sit in traffic for 45 minutes to drive 13 miles each way to work. I now ride my bike 1 mile to work. I used to make things that went on every electronics store shelf. Now I work with Wastewater control systems. It isn't nearly as cool, but I am a lot happier that I get to spend so much time with my family and nature. __eou__ Wow amazing story. Your children will thank you when they grow older. Im happy for you keep making great decisions ;) __eou__

[Serious]Who is someone that you will never forget? __eou__ My ex-fiancee. We had the misfortune of falling in love while we were both in the military, and after she was stationed in Japan, we just couldn't maintain a long-distance relationship. It's been years since I last saw her, and I've been in multiple serious relationships since then, but she's always on my mind. I have this pathetic dream that she'll come back home someday and we can have the life we wanted to have, but I know it'll never happen. __eou__
[Serious]Who is someone that you will never forget? __eou__ Met a girl at a party, ended up having the greatest conversation I've ever had with someone. Ended up going back to my place and talking until like 5am when we both fell asleep. I had to leave for basic training the day after that. Still think about that girl all the time. __eou__
[Serious]Who is someone that you will never forget? __eou__ I met a young boy in a train station who was on his way to live with his grandparents because his parents had both died.

It was really difficult to see someone in so much suffering that I couldn't comfort. __eou__
If you have $100,000 budget to invest, regardless of return, what would it be and why? __eou__ There used to be a restaurant in my town that was a one-of-a-kind joint. They served these sandwiches that were kind of like Sloppy Joes without the sauce and had some other food, and they were extremely popular. But they went out of a business a few years ago because their location was this disgusting, run-down shack in a part of town that isn't really a destination for anything else. If I had the money, I'd buy the recipes and rights to the restaurant's name from the owners, build a new location in a better part of town, and advertise the shit out of it. I'm like, 99% sure it would end up being pretty successful. __eou__
If you have $100,000 budget to invest, regardless of return, what would it be and why? __eou__ I'd buy an old gym and then take in stray / free kittens and fill the swimming pool with them. Then I'd charge people 10$ / half hour to come swim in kittens. Still working out the details. __eou__
If you have $100,000 budget to invest, regardless of return, what would it be and why? __eou__ Probably my friends new marijuana company. Hes super talented and driven and does everything the right way(imo) success is in him. __eou__
Shy people of Reddit, what really goes through your mind when a teacher says "everyone grab a partner"? __eou__ *Why....* __eou__ I don't grab a partner. I just wait till the teacher asks "who doesn't have a partner?" __eou__ That always happened to me, I actually forgot about doing that. Haven't been in high school in a while. __eou__
Shy people of Reddit, what really goes through your mind when a teacher says "everyone grab a partner"? __eou__ *Why....* __eou__ Exactly it. Somehow I ended up with a few kind teachers in high school who recognized how painfully shy I was. After the first few times I ended up being a pretty obvious straggler, the teacher either went around the room counting off numbers, split the class off into 2 sides, or had us work with our neighbors. __eou__
Shy people of Reddit, what really goes through your mind when a teacher says "everyone grab a partner"? __eou__ Oh no. I have to ask someone I am not friends with to be my partner since none of my friends are i thiss class. I would rather die. __eou__ As a teacher if we're doing something in class I've been known to say "you can work with a partner, or, if you'd prefer to work by yourself that is ok too". For this reason. __eou__ Bless you. __eou__

What do you wish you never found out? __eou__ I wish I never found out what a drunken ass my father was. I moved in with him when I was 13. No one ever told me WHY people in the family would speak ill of him, so I went in completely blind. It took me 3 years to get out. He passed away a few years back, but if I had never lived with him, he would have passed away with me believing he is a fun, loving and devoted father. I know it's a good thing I know for me personally (I watch myself when I drink, I know why I react badly to things for seemingly no reason, etc), but a part of me wants to believe I had one parent that looked out for me. __eou__

[Serious] People who have been through gender reassignment surgery, What are some of the things you miss about body if there are any? __eou__ I'm male to female, and had my surgery about a year and a half ago. Honestly, the thing I miss most is being able to pee without making a mess. My pee is no longer a steady stream, it just kind of goes everywhere now. So whenever I pee, it gets all over my crotch and upper legs. It sucks having to clean it up every time, but it's worth it. It is still so much better than the alternative! Peeing while standing up is another small thing I sometimes miss. __eou__ &gt; Peeing while standing up is another small thing I sometimes miss. [I got u fam](http://www.shewee.com/) __eou__ I know this is exists, but I imagine it's still going to be a bit messy. Beats squatting in the woods though! __eou__ Better than getting your socks wet. __eou__ Correct. Wet socks are the worst. __eou__

What was your first kiss like? __eou__ Never experienced it. Turning 18 this year too. __eou__ Don't feel bad. I'm 23 and haven't experienced it. __eou__ For reals? __eou__ Unfortunately. Not so much as even held hands before. __eou__ You're not alone. __eou__ I'm glad I'm not in this boat alone. __eou__
What was your first kiss like? __eou__ Never experienced it. Turning 18 this year too. __eou__ Don't feel bad. I'm 23 and haven't experienced it. __eou__ For reals? __eou__ Unfortunately. Not so much as even held hands before. __eou__ It's okay man. Don't get yourself down about it. I know plenty of people who didn't so much as kiss a girl until they we're 26. I was always nervous when talking to girls/asking them out, but then one of my friends told me this and it completely changed my perspective, "Confidence isn't knowing that she will say yes, confidence is knowing that when she says no, you'll be totally fine." I use to suffer from pretty bad anxiety when I was in my late teens. But one day it kind of clicked with me so to speak. I had spent my entire life being afraid of what other people thought of me, afraid of making a fool out of myself, afraid of being rejected. Because of this, I rarely did anything out of my comfort zone, and I missed out on a lot. But one day, I just decided to stop caring. This is obviously easier said than done, but with a little practice it can be achieved. Just start slowly stepping out of your comfort zone, doing things that you are afraid off(talking to girls, going on a date, making conversation with a stranger). Eventually you'll realize that people are too worried about themselves to even care about you, and that makes life a whole lot easier. Talk to a girl and make a fool out of yourself. It might hurt in the moment, but you'll realize that your okay, that the world is still spinning. Be confident in who you are, because you are the only person you'll ever be. Good luck. I wish you the best. Edit: Forgot to add something. Even if you think you are the most unattractive person in the world, you're not. Sure you might not be able to swoon girls just by looking at them, but an attractive personality is a lot more important than an attractive face. __eou__

What was your first kiss like? __eou__ My first kiss I thought was great. But my boyfriend at the time kissed me and then hopped up and left (we were at school) he then dumped me. I thought it was because I was a bad kisser or something. He said it was for a different reason. Still it made me paranoid and I didn't kiss anyone for another 2 years. Turns out I WAS just paranoid. I'm a great kisser! __eou__
What was your first kiss like? __eou__ Thirty four years and waiting. __eou__
What was your first kiss like? __eou__ We were too young to know about tongue things so it was just a smooshy meeting of faces and he kept calling me, "my darling". We were like 5 or 6. My first proper kiss was when I was 11 or so, and I thought you were supposed to just stick your tongue in and out a bunch of times so that went well. __eou__

Which method is preferred to change sleep cycle - Stay up till the next night ? Or gradually sleeping early ? __eou__ Staying up late, like 24-28 hours to fix it. Got to make sure you sleep early the following night as well because for me it isn't a one night fix. __eou__ Yeah..that's definitely true. It takes a few days of follow up to get the new cycle to normal. __eou__ Having said that, I did use OTC sleeping pills when I had a 8am-3pm sleep schedule for 3 weeks during exams. I wouldn't recommend using them for more than one night but it'll save the pain of an all nighter. __eou__
Which method is preferred to change sleep cycle - Stay up till the next night ? Or gradually sleeping early ? __eou__ Get up extra early. __eou__
Which method is preferred to change sleep cycle - Stay up till the next night ? Or gradually sleeping early ? __eou__ So I had a really fucked up circadian rhythm for a couple months. I was working overnight so I had to sleep during the day. I would typically go to bed around 7 in the morning, and wake up around 2 or 3pm. I eventually got a new job that didn't require me to work all night, but instead at 8 in the morning. It was hell for the first couple of weeks. I tried doing the stay up all night and sleep at a normal time thing, but it didn't work, I was still unable to fall asleep at a reasonable time. Here is what I did, and now waking up at 8am is no problem anymore. * Limit all electronics for an hour before attempting to sleep. Phones and computer screens emit blue light, which inhibits your ability to fall asleep. * Although its tempting, avoid getting wasted. This will make your brain pretty much skip REM sleep, and you will not have a restful sleep. * Read a book before sleeping. I would recommend something boring. Charles Dickens is better than Ambien. * Melatonin Supplements. Although the safety of melatonin is in debate, it is relatively effective when used correctly. Melatonin does not make you fall asleep, it actually "resets your internal clock" so to speak. It tells your brain when you should get tired, but doesn't force you to get tired. This will allow you to readjust into a normal sleeping pattern, and once you have fixed your schedule, you can stop taking it. It also works best in sub milligram doses. So find the smallest tablet you can find(smallest I've found is 2mg) and cut it in half/in fourths. * Do not drink caffeine past 4 in the afternoon at the latest. * If you are just laying in bed and can't fall asleep, get out of bed and go read a book for awhile until your ready. Do not stay in bed if you are just laying their awake. * Put your alarm clock far away from you where you can't see it. It's terrible for sleep if you keep looking at your clock and thinking "well I only have 5 hours of sleep now." Ill add more if I think of it. But thats mostly what I did and now I sleep fine! __eou__ Now THAT is Very insightful. Thanks a lot for taking your time to share that info. __eou__ No problem! Also, avoid sleeping in late on weekends. Its best to stick to a rigid sleep schedule. And once you achieve one, you'll find that you have a lot more time in the day. __eou__

Coaches of kids sport: What's the worst behaviour of a parent you've seen? __eou__ Watching a lady get caught for shoplifting- she stuffed the items under her kid that was sitting in a stroller. She took packages of steaks and boos. she said it was for her kids birthday party, and was totally belligerent and nasty and intitled. How dare we mess up her childs party for stopping her from stealing!!! __eou__ She took some boos? Were they scary? She could always just drink some booze to calm her nerves. __eou__ I knew that looked wrong. Super brain fart 💨 __eou__ I'm all good with someone shoplifting boos from the local market. I dont need any creeping up on me. (This post is one of my favorite typos) __eou__
Coaches of kids sport: What's the worst behaviour of a parent you've seen? __eou__ I coached pop warner football when I was in 8th grade. Weird, but I'd been playing the same plays for the 4 years prior so I knew what I was doing. Anyway, an opposing team's parent got so upset that we were running up the score that he jumped the fence in the middle of the game, ran out on the field, and dragged his kid off the field. __eou__
Coaches of kids sport: What's the worst behaviour of a parent you've seen? __eou__ I coached U6 soccer, and this five year old was playing with his water bottle on the bench. He wasn't bothering anyone, just balancing it on his head and tossing it around and catching it. This poor kids nutjob of a mom storms across the field and snatches it from him, and starts making him do jumping jacks while berating him. I blew the whistle at her and had to explain that no parents are allowed over unless of an injury. I gave that kiddo the biggest hug and told him he did a great job balancing it on his head and wanted him to teach me. Poor kid! __eou__

What minor mistake are you angriest at yourself for? __eou__ Not having closure on my granddad dying. Not going all tinfoil hat but I saw his ghost walking around and following me. It felt like I had guidance during one of the toughest times in my, back then, short life. Only on one day I found closure when I woke up in the middle of the night and I see my desk chair spinning with my grandpa seated in it. He nods his head at me and walks out of the door. After that I've only seen him once and that was at the time I had grown the balls to ask my now GF out for the first time. __eou__

If racism makes you laugh, it just means you lack empathy and have growing up to do. __eou__ Not really no, sometimes the absurdity of something is where the humor is found. __eou__ Hey man, I told you like it is. Don't get mad at me because you haven't matured past 6th grade. __eou__ Nice supporting argument you got their buddy. __eou__ [removed] __eou__

What did you do at 17 that you thought was super cool but now realise it was extremely obnoxious? __eou__ Blasting music out of my car. __eou__ Came here to say this. I saved up and installed the nicest system I've had in my life, even up til now. Trunk was lined so it didn't buzz, competition quality head unit, custom sub enclosure...that was all awesome. The annoying thing I did was when I found out I could go through parking lots and set off car alarms with the system. __eou__ How old do you need to be to not find that hilarious? Because I'm 26 and I seriously want to go set off car alarms! __eou__ Oh, it was funny. Also had a hidden amp switch that would cut the main power and make it impossible to be too loud even if the volume was maxxed, so it was easy to get away with if no one directly saw me. I still prefer to listen to my own music though rather than what someone else is blaring, and it's annoying to hear your alarm going off for no reason that you can tell : ) (If you haven't done it before though it can be fun to say you have at least once ; ) __eou__ This is now on my bucket list. __eou__
What did you do at 17 that you thought was super cool but now realise it was extremely obnoxious? __eou__ Blasting music out of my car. __eou__ Awwww man I used to do this shit too when I was 17. Definitely obnoxious. It's even sadder when I see middle-aged men doing the same thing around town. Like......nobody likes your music, you're not cool, and you look like a dumbass. __eou__
What did you do at 17 that you thought was super cool but now realise it was extremely obnoxious? __eou__ Blasting music out of my car. __eou__ I did this and still do it because it feels good, don't give a fuck whether there's anyone around to hear it or not. That said I don't do it at night or buy half a dozen 18" subs with 5 gigawatt amps and play music that's literally entirely bass just to sound cool. I just think there aren't many better feelings than loud, energetic music while I'm driving on a nice day and in a good mood. I usually turn it down once I get into residential areas too... __eou__
What did you do at 17 that you thought was super cool but now realise it was extremely obnoxious? __eou__ I existed. No seriously though, teenagers are the worst. __eou__ Not necessarily. A lot of us are friendlier than made out to be. Granted, not all of us, but still. __eou__

What did you do at 17 that you thought was super cool but now realise it was extremely obnoxious? __eou__ I used to try to be funny on Facebook. Like commenting funny things on people's statuses and stuff. Not like troll stuff, just what I thought was a funny thing to say. I've stopped doing that because no one is funny on Facebook, and the last thing people want on their status or underneath their picture is some jackass trying to be funny. __eou__
What did you do at 17 that you thought was super cool but now realise it was extremely obnoxious? __eou__ I tried to be socially and politically active, but ended up just talking out of my ass with my half-informed ideas.

It's a wonder I survived! __eou__ I'm not even that much older than these kids, but in my neighborhood there are a lot of rich kids whose parents let them drive their giant Mercedes or Lexus SUV, and they're fucking terrorists on the road. Entirely ignoring stop signs, going around blind corners as fast as they can in the middle of the road, not even attempting to look for other traffic before being stupid. __eou__

What did you do at 17 that you thought was super cool but now realise it was extremely obnoxious? __eou__ I used to be a lot more liberal until the extremist liberal idiots started making me embarrassed. Laying in the road, breaking into cars during "peaceful" protests, setting fire to peoples' property. Now I'm a lot more centrist. Kinda hard to be an extremist centrist, although it's possible I guess. __eou__

Youngest son says he want to play, dad says sure. So son 3 takes off his shoe and throws it in the river. Before dad can react, shoe is gone and dad gets to tell mom why she needs to buy son 3 a new pair of shoes. __eou__
Chicagoans of Reddit, how seriously are you taking the tornado warning? __eou__ About as seriously as I take any other tornado warning: I unplug my electronics so they don't get fragged by power surges, and I go into the basement if I hear warning sirens. __eou__ Understandable, I was just curious because I thought it was impossible for tornadoes to occur in Chicago. __eou__ It's not entirely impossible. It's just unlikely. __eou__

If you could drill a hole through the center of earth and descend down on a rope, what happens with gravity when you get to the center? __eou__ There's an actual answer to this question... You would be stuck in the center. Gravity would would be pushing you at all angles so you would just float... __eou__ So if the hole went the entire diameter of the earth (and ignoring the magma) and you are free falling at 9.8m/s etc and you pass the center of earth, you would then be pulled back towards the center in the opposite direction until you eventually stayed at the center.. __eou__ Yup. But if it was a vacuum, so no air to slow you down, you'd just go through the forever. Interestingly enough, to fall from one end to the other, ignoring any frictional forces like air resistance and, well, friction, it would take 42 minutes, regardless of what angle to tube is at. __eou__ Also applies for all arc lines not just the full diameter of the planet __eou__

If you could drill a hole through the center of earth and descend down on a rope, what happens with gravity when you get to the center? __eou__ When you jump in the hole in Earth you will accelerate more and more to high velocity as you're getting closer and closer the center ( force= zero), then you pass the center you will decelerate more and more until you get to the other opening then you start to fall back to the the center. Like pendulum on and on, until you come to a complete stop at the center of the Earth. I'm just spitballing here, I have no clue. __eou__
If you could drill a hole through the center of earth and descend down on a rope, what happens with gravity when you get to the center? __eou__ You do the splits __eou__ Feel the burn! __eou__

[Serious] Female Redditors: What goes through your mind when considering whether or not to date a man with children? __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ Some friends of mine don't date a guy with kids. For them it's the drama. The fact that they might want to reunite the family back together and depending on the kids age it can take a toll on progressing the relationship when the kids don't understand . Also they want to experience the "firsts" together like marriage, kids, home, and day to day things. It's not a bad thing, just a preference. My friends that are like this are late twenties to early thirties. __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ No problem. I hope you find your forever person. I promise if a lady needs convincing to love you AND your kids, they are not the person for you. It will feel natural and should just click when you do. I have a five year old and he's my shadow. Even with friends if you wanna hang with me you gotta be cool with him. Good luck with your pursuit! __eou__
[Serious] Female Redditors: What goes through your mind when considering whether or not to date a man with children? __eou__ Well, I have always known that I did not want kids, so this would be an instant deal breaker for me. The lifestyle I want just does not include kids - not even some one else's kids. But every woman is different. If I had not been SO dead set on not having kids, these are the topics I would ponder before jumping in: Does this person have a good co-parenting relationship with their ex and how much is the ex still in the picture? How often does this person have physical custody? is it 2 weekends a month or full time? or 50/50? Does the coparenting or divorce decree specify where this person can live (i.e. would they be able to move without the spouse's permission)? How young are the kids? How many does this person have? Do they want more children (if I wanted my own kids this would be really important to know) Is this person a good parent? Does this person pay child support, and if so, are they ever behind or late? No one wants to date a deadbeat. __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ It's awkward when you are meeting some one new - especially when all you have to go on is a dating profile ;) I think that often both parties are worried about either offering TMI, or seeming too intrusive. I think including a few lines in your dating profile that sums it up would help with the women that might consider it, but have questions/reservations (and lets them know that you are willing to talk about it and gives them an opening to ask questions). Something along the lines of: Responsible single dad to 2 great elementary aged kids. I have a cordial co-parenting relationship with their mother, who shares custody 50/50. I am open to having more kids, and looking for a woman who wants the same. __eou__

Americans of Reddit, what is something you hope President Trump will accomplish that will benefit most people in America? __eou__ Honestly, sticking it to companies that exploit H1B visas by raising the minimum salary for an H1B to $160,000 USD/Yr. If anything it will make a lot of terminally-educated lefties happy since their IT and Engineering jobs aren't getting farmed out. The intent of the H1B also remains, a company's ability to import expertise if they *really* need it is still there. __eou__

Americans of Reddit, what is something you hope President Trump will accomplish that will benefit most people in America? __eou__ Not starting a world war __eou__
Americans of Reddit, what is something you hope President Trump will accomplish that will benefit most people in America? __eou__ Less restricted gun laws. I don't know how much he can do from a Federal level but it's kinda disheartening that he hasn't mentioned guns at all since being elected and each day he gives me more reason to want one. __eou__ Guns control is going to be done in by the courts. 4th Circuit just saw to that. __eou__ If I told you I knew how the government works I'd be lying. Taking AP Gov next year though, I feel like it's become important to know. __eou__ 4th circuit basicly just issued a ruling supporting the maryland AWB that could be summarized as; We didn't like the Heller and McDonald ruling so we're just going to pretend they don't exist. The dissent was scathing and the majority ruling is being called nothing short of a complete miscarriage of justice. https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5w6vm8/second_amendment_does_not_cover_weapons_of_war_us/de81mpg/ __eou__ Ohhh that's the whole "weapons of war" thing? That was an atrocity __eou__ Atrocity is being generous. Every judge in that majority should be impeached and disbarred. That's not even just me liking guns talking, the ruling is just that fucking bad. __eou__ It's not even comically bad, it's more like eye-openingly bad. Like "woah people in government are even more incompetent than me" __eou__

Americans of Reddit, what is something you hope President Trump will accomplish that will benefit most people in America? __eou__ Reform the ACA. Before you hit that downvote button and start frothing at the mouth citing people who would be dead if not for the ACA, note I said reform, not repeal. This shits expensive, yo, and I make too much to qualify for subsidies, but not enough to *actually* afford it. __eou__
Americans of Reddit, what is something you hope President Trump will accomplish that will benefit most people in America? __eou__ Impose fucking term limits for Congress. If you've been doing the job for 40 years, you're probably more concerned with preserving your own income than you are with serving the people. Eat a big dick, self serving Congressmen. __eou__
Americans of Reddit, what is something you hope President Trump will accomplish that will benefit most people in America? __eou__ A Wall. *no wait* Massive Nuclear Weapons Stockpiles. *no wait* A Ban on Muslims. *no wait* A renegotiation of every foreign trade deal. *no wait* A tax on imports (formerly known as "Tariffs".) *no wait* A *very* cozy relationship with The Soviet Union (formerly known as Russia.) These things will all benefit Donald Trump and he's arguably "most people in America" at this point. __eou__
Americans of Reddit, what is something you hope President Trump will accomplish that will benefit most people in America? __eou__ Pull our military back from the 150 odd countries that they are now in. Stop dropping bombs and quit the drone strikes on countries we are not in a declared war with. But, sadly, I don't see that happening. Too much money being made. __eou__
Americans of Reddit, what is something you hope President Trump will accomplish that will benefit most people in America? __eou__ Dying a humiliating public death would be pretty beneficial. Maybe he starts giving his speeches from the base of Trump Tower and during one of them, the T falls and crushes him, but in a way that doesn't do him in right away, instead pinning him helplessly so we get to see him squirm for a few minutes. __eou__ Take it down a notch, Hillary __eou__ The Clintons are friends with Trump and always have been. That didn't change after the election. I mean shit, it took her an entire month to make any kind of public statement about resisting Trump, and for one thing it was totally tame and for another, I'm almost positive she only made the statement because her staffers told her it would be political suicide not to. All the shit they talked about eachother during the election was just a show. As far as they were both concerned, Hillary was gonna win and Trump was gonna get a ton of publicity to help him start his new TV network. Unfortunately, Russia had other plans. __eou__ The tin foil hat is strong with this one. __eou__

Maybe he starts giving his speeches from the base of Trump Tower and during one of them, the T falls and crushes him, but in a way that doesn't do him in right away, instead pinning him helplessly so we get to see him squirm for a few minutes. __eou__ Shit like this sends my blood pressure so fucking high. Why in the hell would you wish death upon someone who does not hold the same political views as you? How does that validate your views as being better than his? How does that make you, or anyone who holds the same hope, better than a dictator who wants political opponents dead?What about all this love trumps hate bullshit? Is that only when it benefits your beliefs? People who believe this bullshit are a big part of problem in this country. Trump is not perfect by any stretch but fuck me can he at least be given a chance? No one is talking about the positive things he has done. It seems like everyone wants to bitch about things they do not like. It is almost as if they don't know what it is like to not get their way. Trump has said some stupid shit, yes I will give you that, but he has also done some good things. He has saved money on some military assets, reduced the cost of a new air force one, brought some jobs back stateside, is trying to figure out a way to keep out evil people who will use someone's tragedy to benefit their cause (I'm looking at you ISIS), and trying to limit the amount of illegal immigrants coming into this country. Are his methods the best? Maybe, maybe not but you know what? At least the son of a bitch is trying. Who else would be better to run this shit? Since it is obvious you know who would be better. Hillary? The one who would be bought by big companies and manipulated by those same companies? The one who doesn't know how to handle classified documents, try and hide what she did, and even lie during a congressional hearing? Someone who is married to a sexual predator thus allowing the sexual predator back into the white house? Get real she would have fucked this up even worse. Bernie? The one who wanted free everything? The one who said single payer Healthcare was the way to go? Guess what, the single payer that he implemented in Vermont failed so bad it almost bankrupted the state so they shit canned the idea. Eventually everyone else's money runs out. How would all of his things get paid for? Raised taxes. Instead of hoping for someone to die because you don't like their political beliefs, why don't you try and make a difference? Vote in the congressional elections and try to be an activist in causes that you believe in. Try and educate people on topics that they are clearly ignorant on. Saying you hope he dies just hurts your cause. __eou__

Americans of Reddit, what is something you hope President Trump will accomplish that will benefit most people in America? __eou__ Impose term limits so that the elected officials actually give a fuck about the people who voted them in. Allow people who want to get into this country while making it more difficult for those who want to do harm to this country to get in. Reform immigration so it is difficult for someone to illegally come into this country but make it easier for those going through the proper channels and doing it legally. Bring more jobs back to the US to drop unemployment and thus bettering the economy. Those are just the things I can think of right off. __eou__

How hard is it to get instate tuition? __eou__ If I move to the state before applying just to save tens of thousands __eou__
How hard is it to get instate tuition? __eou__ AFAIK you must pay taxes in the state for a full year before to be considered in state __eou__ I looked into it online and it said I could work there full time for 90 days prior to applying and I would be considered a resident. So I would move there during the summer (june or so), then apply in the fall (after 90 days) and then work full time for a year before going to school. Would that work? It would save me 25k plus I could work to make money for school. This is Alabama by the way. __eou__
What are some details about your profession that other people would be surprised to know? __eou__ IVF doesn't usually result in high order multiples and it doesn't always work. __eou__ Isn't the chance of twins or more higher with IVF, though? Statistically, I mean. __eou__ Intrauterine insemination actually carries the higher rate of twins, triplets, quads, and higher because it's less controlled. Though some doctors will cancel an insemination cycle if a woman has more than 3 eggs ready for ovulation because of the risk. Many RE (reproductive endocrinologists) will only transfer one or two embryos or blastocysts back into the uterus to avoid twins and multiples, since it results in high risk pregnancy. Edit: couples are often surprised to have 22 eggs harvested, find that only 5 fertilized and only 2 grew to embryo stage to be able to be transferred to the uterus in hopes of implanting and growing. __eou__
What are some details about your profession that other people would be surprised to know? __eou__ Tradies make more than most business people that go through years of schooling __eou__ I've been considering a job switch, however additional college isn't an option. Do you mind elaborating on what those options may be, and how you might get into them? __eou__ 1. Depends on where you live, Im Australian so there's probably going to be a difference in wage in between countries. 2. There are heaps of trades that have the potential to make a lot of money, if you have no problem with hard work and starting on lower wage while you're on your apprenticeship. Plumbers, electricians, builders even brick layers and so on. 3. Easiest way would be to find someone in the field and ask if they would consider taking you as an apprentice, as I said I'm from Australia so I don't know exactly how apprenticeships work in the US but generally it's low pay and you need to attend TAFE or I think you guys call them trade schools every now and again. 4. You could also try being an unskilled labourer but from what I've heard that doesn't make anywhere near as much as it does in the states. Hopefully someone from the us can fill in the gaps for you __eou__

Who is wiser? He who knows that he knows nothing? Or he who doesn't know that he knows everything? __eou__ If a person knows nothing, then they don't know they know nothing. To suggest that they know they know nothing would mean that they know something. However the person who doesn't know that they know everything does not actually know everything, otherwise they would know they know everything. But assuming they know everything else, they might be wiser than the person who supposedly knows nothing, although we must be wise and know ourselves that knowledge does not equal wisdom. __eou__ Exactly __eou__

What are some ways to stand out/get a leg up on the competition when applying for jobs after graduating? __eou__ Have some fuarking skills. Forreal, so many people I graduated with had resumes filled with "People-skills, Social Media, Goal-Oriented, Head of ____ Club". Bonus if you have "Microsoft Word" or "iOS" in your "Tech Skills" __eou__ Well it's not that easy for an employer to get an understanding of "fuarking skills" from just a resume and cover letter. Obviously you should have the required skills when applying for a position. __eou__ in that case have a portfolio of your past work linkable or attached nothing, however, will beat a verified work history of similar jobs. __eou__ Yeah, it's just tough when i'm applying for entry level jobs and they expect me to have a portfolio of work from similar jobs. Oh well, thanks for the help. __eou__ okay let's get into more details. What kind of jobs are you applying for? What's your past experience? Are you looking for fulltime or just a part time beer-money job? __eou__ I'm graduating in May and will be applying for full time jobs. I am looking for jobs related to finance. I had an internship with a large credit union working very closely with the financial analyst. I am experienced with Excel and Access. I will be graduating with a 3.96 gpa from a state school. I'm a little overwhelmed with graduation approaching and really don't know where to start. __eou__ Applying for a job is a fulltime job - if you don't have contacts that can help you out, then don't let a day go by without at least 5 applications out (custom resumes and CV's). Your GPA is impressive but keep your education brief still. Many of these places will glimpse at it and move on. It was never a talking point in my interviews either. Your internship (and prior jobs) should be the bulk of the resume. List bullet points for software/skills utilized under each of them. Have a section that is just a pure list of skills, tools, and software you're knowledgeable about. The most important part though might be the cover letter. Custom one for EVERY job. No exceptions. Using this method I landed a job around with the 185th application out of ~240. This was over the course of two months __eou__
What are some ways to stand out/get a leg up on the competition when applying for jobs after graduating? __eou__ Intern, intern, intern. Pro tip, if the company you really want to work in doesn't have official internship programs, offer to work for free (you'll get better exposure than many formal internship programs). Work a second job waiting tables at night if you need to make some money. __eou__
What are your go to conversation topics when things go quiet on a date? __eou__ Usually politics. Religion is a good choice too. __eou__ To add to that, exes are also a good topic. Especially if you still love them __eou__ Good call. That particular topic has saved me a few times. __eou__
What are your go to conversation topics when things go quiet on a date? __eou__ Usually politics. Religion is a good choice too. __eou__ This is what me and my girlfriend endlessly talk about. __eou__ My girlfriend and I.* Oh, that reminds me, correcting their grammar also really gets the conversation flowing. __eou__ Along with the animosity. __eou__ Get your phone out to find things to talk about. __eou__
What are your go to conversation topics when things go quiet on a date? __eou__ There are two options, one safe and shitty, and one risky and shitty. The first is to talk about school/work killing the mood and stressing both of you out. The second is to go *deeper* which she might not be ready for. __eou__
What are your go to conversation topics when things go quiet on a date? __eou__ Asking about their profession is good But talking about the intense experience of psychosis that Batman experiences on the regular is pretty good too. Your choice really __eou__
What are your go to conversation topics when things go quiet on a date? __eou__ Talk about how it hurts that I'm on a date with myself. __eou__
What are your go to conversation topics when things go quiet on a date? __eou__ Everyone's favorite topic is themselves. If the conversation goes stale, ask another question, e.g., her favorite anything vacation, store, show, etc. __eou__
What are your go to conversation topics when things go quiet on a date? __eou__ Music, places in the world you or they want to visit some day, hobbies, sports, t.v. Shows, or if they could be any animal on earth what would it be and why. __eou__
What are your go to conversation topics when things go quiet on a date? __eou__ Things that matter to the person you're on a date with. If they're shy and don't open up that easily, then offer up simple questions that reveal more about each of you and offer to answer first the first time. Then if you need to continue with that, offer for them to ask a question and answer first since you did last time. That keeps it safe for them and can help show that you care about what they want to know as well. __eou__
What are your go to conversation topics when things go quiet on a date? __eou__ If things go quiet, either something got glossed over or you're missing something in common. Go back through the night find something that seemed to interest both of you, and ask a new question about it. On a good date, you shouldn't be jumping from topic to topic. That's like skimming over the body of a 6-hour speech and getting to the end 5 hours early. Just sitting on a stage going, "So what have YOU guys been up to lately?" Or you could pull a hail mary and hope they're not TOO passionate about politics. Also, unless a 6-fingered tornado recently killed your father and your name is Inigo Montoya, don't talk about the weather. __eou__

Since Lent is coming up, Christians/Catholics of Reddit what are your worst Lent experiences? __eou__ Greek Orthodox here. We have to fast from meat, dairy, eggs, oil, fish, and wine during Great Lent.

Long story short I got ran over by a four wheeler after I stopped rolling and my dad found me we were resting before heading to the ER because my ankle was killing me. My dad was putting my helmet in the back of the truck only to realize that the outer shell had been cracked along with some of the Styrofoam inside.

So I guess we'd go back to ye olden timey neighborhood grocer. __eou__
Do you prefer larger homes or smaller homes &amp; why? __eou__ Smaller homes are easier to clean. Plus my dick is an adequate length already. __eou__

Do you prefer larger homes or smaller homes &amp; why? __eou__ Smaller. Large means you fill it with more shit you don't need, and I don't need to prove anything to anyone by buying a huge house. __eou__

What's the craziest thing someone has revealed to you while drunk? __eou__ My SIL who is a complete cunt told me that she was actually in love with her husband's brother.

What's the craziest thing someone has revealed to you while drunk? __eou__ Their dick. __eou__
What's the craziest thing someone has revealed to you while drunk? __eou__ How they abused their last long term partner - pushed her against the wall and held her by her neck. Yes they went to court.

What's the craziest thing someone has revealed to you while drunk? __eou__ My 19 yr old neighbor came out as transgender to me. He said he was a woman and no one in his family knew. Not even his sister, whom i was closer to than him. Never knew why he decided to come out to me. __eou__ Low risk? If you reacted badly then no big deal - and if you were supportive then maybe collateral benefit that you'd tell his sister for him? __eou__ Maybe. Though he asked me not to tell his sister. I mean it was risky. I could have been a huge dick as he didn't know me very well at the time. I could have really fucked his life up. But that's not me. Guess he gambled and won on that front. __eou__
What's the craziest thing someone has revealed to you while drunk? __eou__ My best friend told me she cheated on her husband. She later told me she said it for attention but I don't think I believe her. __eou__
What's the craziest thing someone has revealed to you while drunk? __eou__ Girl I really liked in high school, who I'd not spoken to in months, drunk called me a couple years ago to tell me she wanted to have sex, then went into explicit detail as to what her and I would have been doing if I was in bed with her. Was quite the conversation and apparently was sparked after she saw that I liked something of hers on twitter. __eou__

What's the craziest thing someone has revealed to you while drunk? __eou__ I once got drunk with a dude I work with in the military. After hours of drinking when we were just sitting there smoking he told me a story about how his convoy got ambushed and he killed anywhere between 120-200 people. Went through 4 uploads of ammunition and the next day he tripped and fell then got caught on barbwire. The shift in tone gave me whiplash. __eou__

I'm not inclined to put a great deal of stock in the ideas, but they sure make for entertaining reading if you like that sort of thing. __eou__

Reddit, you're an international spy who's caught a suspect and are trying to get information out of them through mild annoyances, what tactics do you employ? __eou__ I open up my wooden chest.

How did you almost die? __eou__ i almost drowned three times __eou__ Did you piss off a pirate or what? O_o __eou__
How did you almost die? __eou__ The second time was a suicide attempt where I changed my mind at literally the last second. I like the first time better. Doctor: I'm sorry, but you're not pregnant. Mom: I really think I am... Doctor: I'm sorry, but you're not. Your uterus is just full of excess lining and stuff. Here, take this. It'll make your period start and get rid of that stuff. Mom: No, I REALLY think I'm pregnant. Doctor: OK, fine. I guess we can wait one more week. ~One Week Later~ Me: Ohai! Doctor: Uh...you're pregnant. __eou__
How did you almost die? __eou__ When I was three, I had an allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock) to some medicine that I took, luckily I was already in a hospital so I didn't die. I then proceeded to get my head smashed by a giant ass metal thingy. (I don't know the name, I was like 4?) __eou__ Oh, fun. I'm glad I'm not allergic to anything. So, a Transformer tried to kill you? __eou__ Haha no, nothing as interesting as that. It was like a cross trainer I think. __eou__

How did you almost die? __eou__ Some friends of mine thought it would be funny to push me into the swimming pool. I didn't know how to swim and that pool was really deep. Luckily, some stranger yanked me while i was waving my arms around and pulled me up. Never got into a pool since. __eou__
How did you almost die? __eou__ I actually did die from a heroin overdose. The ridiculous amount of booze I drank waiting for shit to get delivered probably didn't help either. Anyway, they brought my sorry ass back and I woke up in the hospital. __eou__
How did you almost die? __eou__ Not too exciting, but from a bee sting because I'm allergic to them. My mom called our doctor, who knew where lived, and said I wouldn't make it to the hospital, to come to his office instead. He was waiting in his parking lot holding a syringe of epinephrine. My eyes and throat were completely swollen shut.... __eou__
How did you almost die? __eou__ Which time? Farm tractor rollover (I was too high....never operate heavy machinery, yada, yada....). Mowing along the top of a road bank. Decided to back out of where I was and a wheel slipped over the edge. Bailed off as she went over and landed in time to look up and see the upside down tractor coming down on me. Leg pinned under the steering wheel, rear tire on the shoulder. Lucky the ground was soft enough to sort of dig/drag myself out. It took a while. Then I had to walk a half mile home. The near death part was when my wife hosed the mud off of me in the yard to go to the doctors office. Damn that water was cold. (Age 50 or so) Almost slid off a mountain at the Royal Gorge in Colorado hiking where I shouldn't have been. Grabbed a handful of cactus needles but saved my ass. (Age 55 or so) Another farm tractor "wheelie incident" pulling out a stump. Filpped her over backwards. That shit happens fast when you let out the clutch with slack in the chain for a big yank. Foutunately the tractor stood straight up and stopped pointing vertical me laying i the bushes behind looking stupid. My wife and little kids were watching. Wife freaked. Kids cheered. (Age 45 ish) Rappelling without a clue. Tied a cotton rope to a pickup bumper and tried lowering myself down a 40' cliff. Got about 10' when the rocky edge sawed my rope in two. Walked away, but had no way back up. Had to swim across the lake to somewhere I could walk out from. (Young and dumb, around 18) Of course then there was the time I went to the emergency room and an obviously stupid doctor who would not listen to me pumped me full of heart drugs and dropped my blood pressure to 70/30. I sort of remember nurses standing over me looking quite concerned. I apparently am hard to kill as people have told me thats about where you kick the bucket. Good thing I didn't know that at the time. There were also years of motocross in the 70's when bikes had crappy suspension and bad brakes. But we didn't care. We were tough guys. A few ambulance rides, broken bones, stitches, and lost girlfriends. And of course the time the retired Colonel came looking for his daughter and found her hiding in the closet naked. Always lock the back door before heading to bed. That seemed like it could have gone real bad at any second. Well, and I reckon I'm one of a very few who have had that happen twice. I was dumber than a post when I was young. Speaking of posts. I was in a bar one night in college, sort of drunk and fairly high, and as I thought myself pretty fast of foot as I used to love interval training, i challenged this guy that was bragging about his high school track prowess to a sprint down the alley next to the bar, about half a block. We lined up, somebody shouted go, and I was kicking his ass! Then I saw the post, a railroad tie buried at the end of the alley to keep cars from driving down it when I was about 3 feet from hitting it at a full sprint. It was pretty much like having about 40 yards to get up to full speed and running into a brick wall. Another emergency room trip, but, hey, I kicked that guys ass. In the interest of full medical disclosure I told the doctor how much I'd had to drink and that I was stoned. She laughed and said "well you probably don't feel nearly as bad as you should" as she set my broken arm. "No pain meds for you." There's a few more but anybody reading this has to have fallen asleep by now. Apologies for any typos or grammar errors but I'm on a tablet and I'm too lazy to proofread such a long winded post. __eou__ [deleted] __eou__
Teachers, students, staff, and others, what is the funniest thing you've seen happen in school? __eou__ I mean, recently we kept asking our trig teacher to demonstrate the angle of elevation because he heils Hitler and doesn't udnerstand why it's funny. Probably funnier things, but it's late. __eou__
Teachers, students, staff, and others, what is the funniest thing you've seen happen in school? __eou__ Kid, in elementary , was caught filling the school with bubbles. __eou__
Teachers, students, staff, and others, what is the funniest thing you've seen happen in school? __eou__ Maybe not the funniest, but it sticks out. Back in the 90s, we had the power-ade machines in commons areas at our high school, there was a way to stick your arm up one of them and basically flip the lever which causes the drinks to come down. Long story short, some kid got his arm "stuck" in one of them. The reason I put stuck in quotes is because I think he just panicked and made it worse, but the fire department didn't have to come. Another one was when someone stole the basketball coach's jeep. __eou__
Teachers, students, staff, and others, what is the funniest thing you've seen happen in school? __eou__ So, this student was doing an oral presentation and frankly, even though her elocution wasn't bad, she was really saying nice instagram quotes bundled together. I kind of called her out on it at the end, but she wasn't my student so I let it slide. I see her a little later and repeat one of her "quotes", she then proceeds to show me her instagram (where she posts pictures of texts she wrote and then printed, allegedly, and she has 14,000 followers) I'm slightly impressed, but it doesn't mean much to me anyway, since the argument "14,000 people think my writing is good" doesn't make your writing good and isn't really an argument. But I see some thing that are good, but not consistent, I make a mental note of it. Later on, I learn than one of "her own invention" is actually a blatant plagiarization of an english poet. For some reason, I found that really funny. I also have no respect for this student anymore. __eou__
Teachers, students, staff, and others, what is the funniest thing you've seen happen in school? __eou__ When I was student teaching, a kid got pantsed. As a lover of slapstick comedy, I had to look away to laugh. __eou__

What is something people ask/tell you all the time? __eou__ They like to point out I'm very short... __eou__ People ask me often, "where's your shoes?" __eou__
What is something people ask/tell you all the time? __eou__ They like to point out I'm very short... __eou__ How do you feel about people calling you short? __eou__ I used to be highly self conscious about it like they were judging me...now I'm too old to give a shit...still get stares when I'm climbing shelves at the store though...I'm only 4'10" __eou__ Ah well damn. I apologize on their behalf, humans. You may be shorter but you are definitely a bigger human than any of them. Others belittle people who are different because they feel bad about themselves. I love them just as well. But I'm loving on you right now so fuck them. __eou__

What is something people ask/tell you all the time? __eou__ How can you see without glasses? *They take off my glasses*. __eou__ I have never taken anyone's glasses off of their face. That's someone's space. Hmmm. Well, I do admit I have put on other people's glasses. Everyone takes it in stride and laughs. But since I have you here, how do you feel about that? For all I know these people are cursing me silently. __eou__

What is something people ask/tell you all the time? __eou__ "Do you have a boyfriend?" __eou__ I love your username. So do you have a boyfriend? Seriously though, what's up with that? That's common? Does that shit bother you? Assuming you're female, that must be a completely different world. I'm a guy and I am not very straightforward like that so have never said much like that. __eou__ Thank you! No, I don't have a boyfriend which I think makes it even more annoying that they ask. Mostly when I go out to bars or clubs, why can't they ask me about stuff that actually makes me who I am? And if that's all they care about than I prob don't want to talk to them anyway. I'm glad you're not one of those, OP. __eou__

What is a typical personality difference between graduates and non-graduates? __eou__ [deleted] __eou__
What is a typical personality difference between graduates and non-graduates? __eou__ I don't know if it's a personality difference, but it seems most graduates wish they were still in college and most college students just wish they had already graduated. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. __eou__ Now that I see the other comments I see that this question is somewhat ambiguous. I read it as what's the difference between those who have already graduated and those who are still in school and will someday graduate. Most others so far took it as the difference between people who went to college and graduated and those who will never graduate. I think there is a big difference there. I think the difference between people who graduated from college and those who never went or didn't finish college is obvious. __eou__
What is a typical personality difference between graduates and non-graduates? __eou__ Maybe the drive to actually graduate? __eou__
What is a typical personality difference between graduates and non-graduates? __eou__ Graduates have a goal. Nongraduates are either drifting or have different priorities. __eou__
What is a typical personality difference between graduates and non-graduates? __eou__ In general, graduates possess a fuller vocabulary. Is this a personality trait? I submit that it is. __eou__

That was exactly the argument that transpired. Mostly its religious people that believe that only God should make that decision. __eou__ I love the god argument. If that's how you want to play it, then take them off life support and see if the lord saves them. __eou__ From their perspective it's murder. In this day in age it seems downright silly, but to them, it's better to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on someone who is a vegetable yet alive, than to just let them die naturally as they would had they have lived 100 years ago. __eou__

If that's how you want to play it, then take them off life support and see if the lord saves them. __eou__ I actually go to Catholic school and my Ethics teacher said that was perfectly fine, a person can refuse medical treatment outside of basic care (such as feeding and cleaning). So if a person wants to take themselves off life support, they can choose to do so and they'll "die naturally." The difference is if a person doesn't require life support but still has a terminal illness, they can't resort to PAS or euthanasia. They just have to die. __eou__ &gt; So if a person wants to take themselves off life support, they can choose to do so and they'll "die naturally." Generally speaking, people on life support can't make decisions for themselves. They are on life support, which usually means a ventilator and feeding tube. If there is a case where someone had the ability to do this I'm unaware of it. &gt;The difference is if a person doesn't require life support but still has a terminal illness, they can't resort to PAS or euthanasia. They just have to die. If you know you are going to die, you should be able to do so before you get to the point where you can no longer take care of yourself. This is where separation between church and state becomes a factor in law making. Religion should not be a basis of argument for laws. __eou__ I'm an atheist. All of my Catholic friends felt that PAS/euthanasia should be legal. Even our teachers told us it was a topic of debate and it conflicted them. No one claimed that religion should be a basis of these laws and I have no idea why you even mentioned that. My grandfather was on life support. He laid in bed with a feeding tube and some other stuff I can't remember (I was eight). He was still able to write and communicate via some other method before he passed. Even if some people can't communicate on life support, your argument still makes zero sense. How does the person on life support request euthanasia if they can't make decisions? Removing themselves from life support and requesting death pills takes the same amount of effort. As for requesting euthanasia before they are on life support, religious people say they could just simply request no life support instead of committing suicide. I'm literally stating why your sardonic comment about religious people and life support is wrong and you decide to tell me why euthanasia should be legal? Instead of trying to tell me something I already know why don't you explain why you think Catholics or other religious groups would be so against taking away life support? __eou__ You win. I was wrong. __eou__

What morally wrong act would you commit for $100,000? __eou__ I'd go to confession and make up a bunch of ridiculous shenanigans __eou__ My experience growing up Catholic was to do that in order to avoid having to actually confess what I'd really done.

What are your worst substitute teacher stories? __eou__ Sitting in a product design class with a substitute teacher who was from Singapore. I was sitting at the back with a mate who was eating iced animals (biscuits). When the teacher noticed this he loudly exclaimed, " if I catch you eating again I'll make you eat mah balls". It took us a moment to realise the meant marbles, due to to his accent. Cue laughter for the next 20 mins. __eou__

I LITERALLY complimented her and I get SENT to the office? I hated her ever since. I still see her when going to pick up my little sister from school. __eou__ When you go to drop your sister off you should be like "Hey! That outfit makes you look fat." __eou__
What was the dumbest thing you got punished for in school? __eou__ I got detention for eating candy in class in high school as a senior. 8 of 11 students in my AP Calculus B/C class got detention. We had no class that day, the teacher left the room and allowed the class Valedictorian to pass out cards with lollipops on them. Most of the students ate the lollipop. Then the teacher came back in and *flipped out* like we were the worst students ever and gave anyone eating the lollipop detention, which was most of the class. __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ Yup __eou__
What was the dumbest thing you got punished for in school? __eou__ I was playing baseball at recess in elementry. I was outfield. The ball came towards me. I ran for it yelling "I got it". A boy started running for it to. He passed me and bent over. I tripped over him. He got up and told me to watch were I was going. I mocked him, he punched me in the nose almost breaking it. I ran to the teacher. We both ended up in the principle's office. I had do to a think paper on being "rude". He got a slap on the wrist and a think paper for hitting me. __eou__
What was the dumbest thing you got punished for in school? __eou__ There was a fan in our restroom in elementary.

What was the dumbest thing you got punished for in school? __eou__ I and another kid liked to fight, which mostly just meant throw each other to the ground.

But when I got back to class, I got punished for using the fact that my shoulder hurt as an excuse to skip class. __eou__
What was the dumbest thing you got punished for in school? __eou__ Not 100% "punished", but, my guidance counselor took me out of lunch in order to discuss certain websites I had viewed. I was extremely upset by this and asked him what it was that I had viewed that would be of concern. He told me that I had an excessive amount of website views that were of very skinny models and that he was scared I had an eating disorder. Instantly knowing the reasons why I had viewed "such material" I asked him what class I was in when I had viewed them. He said "fashion marketing" I said "well there is your answer, can I go back to lunch now? I am starving" __eou__

What was the dumbest thing you got punished for in school? __eou__ We had a substitute teacher in my 8th grade history class. A buddy and I switched seats (they were assigned seats) and pretended to be each other. Well as stupid as this sounds, about halfway through the who class is laughing at the substitute thinking I was my buddy and he was me. Well the substitute starts getting upset at the class because we are laughing under our breath. So my friend throws a paper airplane at the sub (I know dick move) and got in trouble and was written up. Well fast forward to the next day, my actual teacher asks me to stay after class. He tells me I was written up for being disrespectful and throwing a paper airplane at the substitute teacher. I tried to explain the situation to my teacher, but he wouldn't listen. I got 2 weeks detention, a referral, and had to get my parents to sign a weekly behavior report for a month. All because my friend threw a paper airplane from my desk. In fairness to my friend, it was the greatest con middle school Chapps had ever experienced. __eou__
What was the dumbest thing you got punished for in school? __eou__ I got in trouble for spraining my arm on broken playground equipment.

What was the dumbest thing you got punished for in school? __eou__ I was about 10ish and I pointed out a spelling mistake in a book and the teacher screamed my head off about it being irrelevant to the lesson. Funny thing is, there was another kid who found something like that in a different book and he got praised for it (by the same teacher). __eou__
What was the dumbest thing you got punished for in school? __eou__ In first grade, I found a picture of a nude woman on the ground at recess. Kept it and showed it to a couple friends in class. Teacher saw and it was like we got caught with a pound of meth. Literally ripped us in front of the entire class. __eou__
What was the dumbest thing you got punished for in school? __eou__ Three days out of school suspension for missing too much school. This was in the late 90's, I was a senior in High School. **The principal explaining this to me:** You've missed too much school, so we have decided to suspend you. **donteatpoop:** Ah man, that sucks. (thinking it's about to be IN-School) **Principal:** Yes, you will not be permitted to be on school property for three days. (reads me the dates and what-not) We will be notifying your parents. **donteatpoop:** Wait, so I don't have to go to school for three days? **Principal:** I don't think you understand, any work you miss during this time will not be allowed to be made up. **donteatpoop:** So I don't have to go to school AND I don't have to do homework? **Principal:** You also will not be able to make up any missed tests. **donteatpoop:** I don't have to study either??? **Principal:** Get out of my office. lol. The principal was a good guy, I think he realized the foolishness of the policy but was required to hand it out. Having raised kids of my own now, it's now an IN-school suspension for this. Somewhere along the line someone realized how stupid the rule was. This principal also busted me for printing off homebrew beer recipes from the school computer. Stole the print-offs too and talked to me in his office about proper use of the computers. The whole time he's talking to me I'm insinuating that he plans on making the beer for himself and asking him which one hes' going to make first. When the meeting was over and he told me I couldn't use the computers for (I forget how long, weeks?) I told him to let me know how the beers turn out. There was a 'no unnatural hair color' rule. I had green hair and someone snitched. Seriously no one noticed, but when the principal was dealing with some other kid with miscolored hair that kid said "Well donteatpoop has green hair!" So the principal sat me down in his office and I'm like "What did I do?" and he said: "I had to talk to a student with bright red hair and he mentioned you had green hair." I was like "oh." And he was like. "So you do... Okay, get back to class." Like I said, he was a cool guy. **edited to break up a wall of text** __eou__

What was the dumbest thing you got punished for in school? __eou__ Oh man, in high school I used to get sent to the office like 2 to 3 times a week. One time in particular... I got kicked out of my high school Spanish class because I laughed at the word "negro" ..... Not even laughed, like I barely chuckled. My teacher immediately shouted at me, "do you think racism is funny!?!?" And I said "What? Noooo! I don't think racism is funny." And then she shouted "GO TO THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE!" So I grabbed my shit, left class and walked all the way to the principle's office. And when I got there one of the office ladies asked "Why? Are you here?" And I said "Mrs. ------ kicked me out of class because I told her that I didn't think racism was funny." And the office lady paused for a few seconds and then said " Just .... Go back to class." **And that was it.** I walked back to class. And the teacher said "I thought I told you to go to the office!?" And I said "Yeah. I did. They told me to go back to class." __eou__
What was the dumbest thing you got punished for in school? __eou__ My husband not me. One day he decided he was going to steal all of the little tyre valve caps from all of the teachers cars. He then proceeded to hide them in his front coat pocket. Great plan except the zip on said pocket was broken and as he went to take the coat off the pocket opened spilling all of the caps out onto the floor in front of the head of year.

What severe weather or natural disasters do you have to prepare for where you live? __eou__ I moved to Chicago last November after months and months of people warning me about the brutally cold winters (like.. exclusively. Nobody said anything about the culture or the food or anything else - just that it gets really cold in the winter. I guess a few people also warned me about violent crime too) but it turns out global warming already did away with the cold. Numerous people told me February would be the coldest month - that it would likely not even get above 0 for the whole month. Most of the month has been in the 40s-60s and I think it even hit 70 once. It's been pleasant but very ominous. ...so to answer the question, traditionally the severe weather you would prepare for in Chicago is extreme cold, but it's looking like now it'll be huge storms brought on by a broken climate. __eou__
What severe weather or natural disasters do you have to prepare for where you live? __eou__ Tornadoes, floods, ice storms, zombies and the occasional mild earthquake __eou__

What is the most complicated way to kill someone? __eou__ Steal 10000 flashlight and point them at your target. Burn them to death. __eou__ I guess a lot that would depend on the type of flashlight. If you robbed 10k LED flashlights and pointed them at someone they probably would get annoyed at the light but not much else. But I do have a huge rechargeable flashlight that takes a car headlight bulb. I've killed flies and spiders with that thing just because of the heat it puts out. You have to chase them with the beam for a while until they drop, but they eventually do. 10k of those flashlights would be very very toasty. __eou__

What is the most complicated way to kill someone? __eou__ Here's what you're gonna want to do. For about 6 or 7 months, you want to have the person over to your house once a week, and you make them a delicious sandwich. Turkey club on a Portuguese role with liberal mayo application. But you include just a slight sprinkle of cocaine, just enough to cause a psychological addiction. They'll think they just really love your sandwiches and will beg for you to make one every time they come over. Then, just when they're addicted to the sandwiches (cocaine), you start adding extremely thin lead and arsenic sprinklings. And just watch them devour 1, 2 maybe even 3 sandwiches per visit, cause they're delicious and laced with addictive drugs. And the lead and arsenic will slowly build up in their system. When the poisoning starts getting really bad, and they're sick at home, you call them up, and offer to bring them a huge care package. But of course you lace every item in the care package with even more poison. And then they die with no idea why as they eat a poisoned king sized kit-kat bar and drink an arsenic laced gatorade. __eou__

When I get back they are arguing over the phone again because this time it "didn't have enough pepperoni"??? So I go out on a different delivery and when I get back, the couple are at the store and 3 sheriffs too all because of a free topping and their second pizza that they got for free. __eou__

All 45 US presidents engage to a fight to the death. Who makes it out alive? __eou__ Teddy of course. This isn't even fair. __eou__ Right? Well...Lincoln was a wrestler, so it'd probably be Teddy vs Lincoln as the last 2 standing. __eou__ Wasn't Jackson shot like 3 times? __eou__ Yeah, but he relied solely on guns. Guns are cheating in a death match. __eou__ He also had his trusty cane __eou__

All 45 US presidents engage to a fight to the death. Who makes it out alive? __eou__ Teddy of course. This isn't even fair. __eou__ Fact. Teddy carried a gun around the White House. __eou__
All 45 US presidents engage to a fight to the death. Who makes it out alive? __eou__ Teddy of course.

Damn he looked so badass! __eou__ Yup that's him at Harvard. He literally dove off a horse and stabbed a cougar to death for attacking his hunting dogs. __eou__
All 45 US presidents engage to a fight to the death. Who makes it out alive? __eou__ Teddy of course. This isn't even fair. __eou__ Teddy was very interested in fighting and appearing tough but suffered from asthma and did not spend enough time fighting to be any good. Lincoln was a really good wrestler and a physical specimen. Stories about him and his axe say that he could clear the same amount of timber as three regular men. __eou__ When he was young. Heard he was messed up physically when he was president. __eou__ He suffered a lot in youth, but that's what makes Teddy so badass. He did fight plenty. Then again so did Lincoln. I don't know if I could choose one or the other. It's one of those things, Teddy's got strength but Lincolns got reach. Lincoln's in the goddamned wrestling hall of fame and famously beat a whole towns worth of tuffs to a standstill and declared "I'm the big buck of this lick if you want to try it come whet your horns" I don't think any of the other 43 even come close. __eou__

Teddy was a boxing champion in his weight class at Harvard. He beat the hell out of an armed cowboy in a bar for drawing his gun on him and calling him four-eyes. He was America's first brown belt in judo. He also studied Jiu-Jitsu. His asthma affected him more during his childhood than his adult life. Lincoln was a specimen too, but you are way too dismissive of TR. __eou__
All 45 US presidents engage to a fight to the death. Who makes it out alive? __eou__ Teddy of course. This isn't even fair. __eou__ This is the ONLY correct answer. Washington &amp; Jefferson were big dudes, as was LBJ. But Teddy is straight up tenacious, intensity in ten cities, knife a fucking cougar to death kinda madman. Teddy Roosevelt is a guy you hear a story about and think "that can't be true..." And find out that it's all true. __eou__

All 45 US presidents engage to a fight to the death. Who makes it out alive? __eou__ Ulysses S Grant or George Washington. They were both generals, but they were both infantry before that. Killed plenty of people, probably one or two by hand. High military experience beats being a back alley brawler like Jackson any day. __eou__ Jackson had military experience too. He was a war hero in the War of 1812, and also caused an international incident during the First Seminole War when his unit basically stole Florida from the Spanish with little more than harsh language and warning shots. __eou__

All 45 US presidents engage to a fight to the death. Who makes it out alive? __eou__ Obama. 39 of the 45 are dead, so they'll be no trouble. Of the remaining 6, Obama is easily the healthiest and fittest- all but Trump and he are getting very far on in years, and I have no doubt that Obama could finish Trump within a few minutes. Edit: I now realise that Trump is older than some former presidents other than Obama. Actually, it's possible that all the former Prezs would team up to take Trump down, then splinter. He hasn't endeared himself to any of them. Following that I'm thinking that the Bush family would team up, so it would accidentally fall along party lines. Of course Cater is in his 90s so I'm guessing by this point he'll have had a heart attack. * If G.W and G.H are left I expect that GH would choose to die and let his son live.

I think he could do it, if he needed to. No disrespect- I'd probably kill Clinton to save my life. And Clinton looked pretty ill while he was supporting Hillary's campaign. * If Carter is somehow still alive he'd be easy enough to finish off. He has no natural familial allies unlike his age counterpart, GH Bush. He's no threat so I'd personally leave him until last so I can ensure he gets a relatively painless send off rather than a brutal one in the heat of battle. __eou__ Trump is older than Clinton or W. Clinton has has health issues, though. W. was actually quite fit. Worked out all the time. He's easily the fittest since at least a Teddy. __eou__ Huh, my mistake. Although he is yet to feel the artificial aging of presidential responsibility. Money's still on the O-man though. Also when Obama inevitably becomes involved in porn, I hope that's his pseudonym. __eou__
All 45 US presidents engage to a fight to the death. Who makes it out alive? __eou__ Obama. 39 of the 45 are dead, so they'll be no trouble. Of the remaining 6, Obama is easily the healthiest and fittest- all but Trump and he are getting very far on in years, and I have no doubt that Obama could finish Trump within a few minutes. Edit: I now realise that Trump is older than some former presidents other than Obama. Actually, it's possible that all the former Prezs would team up to take Trump down, then splinter.

I'm not sure whether she could take Trump in a fair fight, but she's got a pragmatic streak a mile wide. She's scrappy. Shame she's also awful. __eou__

Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ I believe most people should have their mouth krazy glued. __eou__ That's a frightening belief :p __eou__
Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ Please be more precise than simply saying "hate speech". __eou__
Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ No I don't. I think people need to just understand what sticks and stones mean.. __eou__

Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ There should be no limits on expressing one's opinion, but things like falsely accusing others of crimes and shouting "FIRE!" in a crowded theater need to stay illegal. __eou__
Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ What this video says- https://youtu.be/xQEYLvnrJNc __eou__ That's a good video thanks for the information and link. __eou__ :) __eou__
Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ Germany does it best. __eou__ What about Germany's speech policy do you believe makes it the best? __eou__ Because any system that's absolutely unregulated can be attacked with that same freedom. Germany learned this with the Nazi's. America might learn it from our current state of racial tensions and the media's role in it __eou__ Is intellectual diversity not inherently good though? Without the free exchange of ideas, how can one agree that a country has truly progressed and not just experiencing a less radical form of something they're trying to avoid? __eou__ "Kill all x" rhetoric not only doesn't add anything meaningful to the discussion, but has also been tested a few times throughout history. You can safely categorize it the same way we do threats. __eou__ I agree that calls to violent action certainly don't belong in rhetoric and are unproductive. Do you believe America is experiencing anything near the "kill all x" mentality to that which you're comparing it? __eou__ There are a lot of people who feel that way in America already. __eou__ Well you'll find anecdotes of bigotry no matter where you go, but I'm specifically speaking with regard to the example you gave - America is treading down a similar path as Nazi Germany did. I can't agree that there is anywhere close to a majority, or even a large number, of genocide supporters in America. Would you agree? __eou__ There wasn't in Germany either __eou__
Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ Germany does it best. __eou__ I'm too lazy to look it up, can you please tell me what exactly Germany's speech policy is? __eou__
Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ As long as freedom of speech does not mean freedom from responsibility for what you say then there should be no limitation. However, you need to realize that when you stand up there's a very real chance you will be knocked down. And by freedom of speech I mean you won't be prosecuted or silenced by the government. Not freedom to run your mouth with the idea that no one has a right to put a fist in it. __eou__ Certainly no one has a right to punch anyone for speech they dislike. We can agree on that, right? __eou__ I have to agree with the person above. Hate speech, when it doesn't respond to peaceful protest, needs to get popped in the mouth. I've never put my hands on anyone, nor do I plan to, but if someone was being a prick to someone, in a clear hateful way, if the person does not respond to a healthy discussion calling on them to shut the fuck up, I'd like to think that I would try to fuck that person up. I'm thinking i would kick their knees out first and then unleash on them, while screaming "you don't know where I've been" as I bleed all over them, like that scene in Fight Club. Ideally the asshole shouting hateful things would have a moment of clarity and simply stop. __eou__ This proposes a serious ethical question about when it's okay to use physical force against someone over whom you have no authority. I strongly disagree that this sort of violence is or should be in any way acceptable. __eou__ Did it need an /s? Just locker room talk #maga ;) __eou__ Haha oh if it's just locker room talk than that's aaight __eou__

Not freedom to run your mouth with the idea that no one has a right to put a fist in it. __eou__ Certainly no one has a right to punch anyone for speech they dislike. We can agree on that, right? __eou__ I am not altogether clear on that no. Until recently it was common for men to, on occasion put their hands on one another. And during those same rather uncivilized times there were far fewer acts of mass violence, far fewer indiscriminate killings and innocent bystanders. Of course, we should abhor violence. But to allow that to become a license for someone to simply pop off with whatever shit comes to mind? The protection of speech was not intended to be protection from your neighbors when you talk shit. __eou__
Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ no limits ever just be an adult and accept the consequences of what you say. __eou__
Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ Only stuff like death threats and yelling fire in a crowd. I'm jealous of America's First Amendment. __eou__ We've quite a problem with many citizens understanding what it means. __eou__
Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ I don't think their should be limits. However, I wish people would understand what free speech really entails and that your favorite "duck dynasty" character being kicked off the show for making racist comments isn't actually violating free speech. __eou__ If a person in TV says something that's perceived as racist, they're acting as an agent of whatever show/network they represent. You forfeit your 'free speech' when on the clock at most places. That's not to say you can be criminally punished, but as in the example you cited, you can definitely lose your job. __eou__ Exactamundo! __eou__
Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ I believe that there are unacceptable types of free speech,e .g., yelling "FIRE!" in a crowded theater. __eou__
Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ There should be no limits on speech, regardless of content.. The behaviour of SJW's and the left to shut down opposing opinions is reprehensible... __eou__
Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ If you're threatening someone or decide to yell "FIRE!" (or worse) in a crowded place (or any place, really), then you should go to jail for that. Otherwise, *hell no*; if people want to send you to jail because "you hurt their feelings", then they need to stop being such pussies and get a thicker skin (either that or just fuck off). __eou__
Do you believe in limits on free speech and to what degree? __eou__ No limit from the government - unless it causes potential physical harm However private organizations can do whatever. __eou__

Who is the most annoying person you know, and why are they so annoying? __eou__ Guy I work with. Always comes into work and immediately asks me a question about myself, not because he wants to hear my answer, but because he wants to answer it himself. Example: "Hey Zip, how was your night." "I guess it was fine, I went---" "Wow thats cool, yeah I did a whole bunch of awesome stuff and now I'm going to tell you how awesome I am. I am the coolest, oh my gosh you wouldn't believe how cool I am." __eou__

Complained about every fucking thing. They have a good ass life and bitch about everything. Their son is in pharmacy school, their daughter is married with a baby, and they run a good business to the point the husband doesn't need to work. Then when they find something to do like go to a cultural festival that they force my parents and me to go to they just bitch about the parking and complain about the food at the festival. __eou__

What's something nice you've done for someone that they didn't know you did? __eou__ Came out of a Barnes and Noble and someone had left their window open and it was starting to rain. So I took a cheap 2$ poncho and weighted it down with my coffee on the roof, and placed an end under their windshield wiper as a makeshift rain guard. __eou__ What a champ! __eou__
What's something nice you've done for someone that they didn't know you did? __eou__ I paid for a roommate's rent for a little over a year. She had been struggling to find a job and one of her brothers had just been diagnosed with cancer. She spent a lot of time looking after him during his last weeks and was worried that she would become homeless, so I just started covering her fees anonymously. She would come in whenever it was due and talk about her guardian angel who is taking care of her, and I would just support her and say 'that's good!' I didn't want her to feel bad, and I didn't want her to pay me back so I figured the easiest way to do it would be to not tell her it was me. Her brother passed about 10 months after his diagnosis and it took a lot out of my roommate (understandably), so even though she was home and not working I had no intention of telling her to find a job yet. So I just kept paying it until one day she finally found a good job at a place that totally suited her passions, and shortly after we moved into a much nice place. She always jokes about finding her guardian angel one day and meeting them, and it was some of the happiest things she said since her brother died. I think I'll just let her joke a little longer. __eou__ I mean, I replace the liquid soap in the bathrooms and I know none of my roommates know who it is. But I think yours sounds a little better. __eou__

So I just kept paying it until one day she finally found a good job at a place that totally suited her passions, and shortly after we moved into a much nice place. She always jokes about finding her guardian angel one day and meeting them, and it was some of the happiest things she said since her brother died. I think I'll just let her joke a little longer. __eou__ You're a good person, a really good person. __eou__ Aw, thanks :) To be honest I get super uncomfortable when people compliment me to my face, I have no idea why. I didn't post this to have people say I'm nice, I just posted it because I hadn't told anyone else and I figured the internet is pretty big and it's easy for comments to get lost in Reddit! But thank you so much again, it means a lot :) __eou__ That's what a good person is, they do things and don't expect thanks. __eou__

So now when I find pencils with a decent eraser left I just leave them on her desk for her. __eou__

What's something nice you've done for someone that they didn't know you did? __eou__ When i was managing a store we had a competition to choose employee of the month, voted by employees, I 'lost' all the votes for myself leaving just the vote I had done for one of the girls at work who had been struggling with lots of personal shit, but trucking on, - it was a stupid prize but it made her day and made her feel really liked at work. And truly I didn't deserve it, I was really nice to my staff and sorted their shit, but I hardly did any work. __eou__

[Serious] Has anyone cut off contact with their family? How is life now? __eou__ [deleted] __eou__
[Serious] Has anyone cut off contact with their family? How is life now? __eou__ I haven't talked to my dad in like 4 or 5 years. Life is pretty much the same since he didn't talk to me for the 10 before that. __eou__
[Serious] Has anyone cut off contact with their family? How is life now? __eou__ I cut off all contact with my brother. It's been about 2 years since we've spoken. I do feel sad from time to time, but I think that sadness is rooted in nostalgia and pity for him. He has a lot of emotional issues and needs to go get help, but refuses to do so. Got sick and tired of it spilling over into my life, so I booted him. He lives in the same apartment complex as my mom and in the next town over from mine. I see his car every now and then and on rare occasions we'll see each other at the grocery store if I'm in the area, but I look away. I wish him all the happiness and success in the world, but he doesn't deserve a spot in my life. __eou__
[Serious] Has anyone cut off contact with their family? How is life now? __eou__ It's definitely a tough call - I haven't spoken with my mom in about 15 years. I've actually lost count, it could be longer than that. It's always a sad fact of my life, but I do feel I've made peace with my decision. Some in my family understand, others think I'm horrible, or at least bitter. It was a hard decision to make, and most definitely painful. The sad reality is that - unfortunately - my life is better without my mom in it. Do I wish that things could be different? Absolutely. But, that requires both parties to be willing to grow. Whether she is unwilling to change, or at this point, unable, I'm not sure. But, as things stand now, I expect we will remain estranged. __eou__
[Serious] Has anyone cut off contact with their family? How is life now? __eou__ Yes, and life is much better without the stress my extended family caused me. __eou__
[Serious] Has anyone cut off contact with their family? How is life now? __eou__ Told my biological father to "fuck off and die"about 4.5 years ago. Life is good. __eou__
[Serious] Has anyone cut off contact with their family? How is life now? __eou__ I cut off contact with my father for 12 years. The only reason I did call him after that time was that he had a heart attack, lost his job (his reason for living) and his cunt of a wife died (yay) Calling was a waste of time. He called at 2am drunk, as usual and I told him to never call me again. He died not long after that. This was 20 years ago and I have had NO regrets about the choice to remove him from my life. __eou__
[Serious] Has anyone cut off contact with their family? How is life now? __eou__ Better. I broke it for a bit, it was a terrible idea. Had to move again to feel safe. __eou__

What is something not considered a stereotype but you commonly see in certain groups of people? __eou__ Black people tend to have very nice teeth. __eou__ That's not really true, white just shocks you more, I usually think my teeth are perfect and see they are very yellow when compared to something white... __eou__ Well I don't stare at black people's teeth all day, but from social interaction, they typically have nice teeth IMO. Guess it isn't a stereotype but I'm also not really out looking for black people with imperfect teeth. __eou__

What's a sensation that you're unsure if other people experience? __eou__ Consciousness __eou__
What's a sensation that you're unsure if other people experience? __eou__ [removed] __eou__ Sounds vaguely like depersonalization. People with anxiety get it sometimes, including me. __eou__ It's true I have anxiety especially in social settings it like my body is just going through the motions of life and I feel detached __eou__ Yup, look up depersonalization or derealization, my friend. It's a more common phenomenon then you think. __eou__
What's a sensation that you're unsure if other people experience? __eou__ Feeling like you're in a constant fucking fog. Not noticing things literally right in front of your face or not hearing things people say to you. Not remembering things that happened 2 seconds ago. Not being able to perform simple, menial tasks because your mind is concentrating on 10 other meaningless thoughts simultaneously like watching 10 different TV channels all at once. Feeling so exhausted that you actually couldn't sleep if you tried. You know, that kind of sensation. __eou__ Yep. That's called depression. Seek psychiatric help. I'm not being glib. You described the general malaise that most of us who suffer from depression feel. __eou__ I don't know, several years and no luck with treatment. I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall and opening up a can of worms at the same time. I've tried countless meds that either don't work or have undesirable side effects/adverse effects. I've kind of given up. I put up a pretty mean front though. __eou__ I'd try looking for a new therapist. Talking it out with someone truly receptive can do wonders. __eou__ Thank you for the encouragement; somehow means more from a stranger than a friend. __eou__
What's a sensation that you're unsure if other people experience? __eou__ I can almost bet no one has experienced stubbing their toe and having their nose tingle...also it's a safe bet that they don't have extremely hot water hit their finger tips and have their nose tingle...everything makes my nose tingle __eou__
What's a sensation that you're unsure if other people experience? __eou__ Every once in a while, a burning sensation in the penis after going to the toilet. Only once every few months. But damn is it uncomfortable. __eou__
Should the U.S. implement mandatory military service to curb the wussification of snowflakes/generation Z and bring respect back to law enforcement? Why or why not? __eou__ No, though non combat military duty for young adult repeat offenders might not be too bad. __eou__

Should the U.S. implement mandatory military service to curb the wussification of snowflakes/generation Z and bring respect back to law enforcement? Why or why not? __eou__ It wouldn't help. Trust me, there are plenty of snowflakes in the military. __eou__
Should the U.S. implement mandatory military service to curb the wussification of snowflakes/generation Z and bring respect back to law enforcement? Why or why not? __eou__ 🙄 __eou__
Should the U.S. implement mandatory military service to curb the wussification of snowflakes/generation Z and bring respect back to law enforcement? Why or why not? __eou__ No. No matter what the government shouldn't be able to own your body - that's the underlying statement governments make when they implement mandatory service. __eou__ Well don't they kind of with the draft? __eou__ Yes. It's one the most immoral policies there are. __eou__
Should the U.S. implement mandatory military service to curb the wussification of snowflakes/generation Z and bring respect back to law enforcement? Why or why not? __eou__ No, they should do it so ignorant hicks from flyover country will find out what the rest of the country looks and sounds like. __eou__ Judgy! Just remember the Midwest represents a disproportionately large proportion of the military that protects snooty sheltered snowflakes on the coasts. __eou__ Oh, do you feel micro aggressed? Do you need a safe space or hug? __eou__ It's past your bedtime, little girl. __eou__ Aww, somebody's feels got hurt. __eou__
Should the U.S. implement mandatory military service to curb the wussification of snowflakes/generation Z and bring respect back to law enforcement? Why or why not? __eou__ You know all those crazy rednecks that spout random conspiracy and mah government corruption? We'll they just got Military training.... Not everyone should have military training. At the same time its benefits would teach civilian society to be more orderly and productive. __eou__
Should the U.S. implement mandatory military service to curb the wussification of snowflakes/generation Z and bring respect back to law enforcement? Why or why not? __eou__ Imo, no. It won't change their mindset, it will only give them the idea that they know what they're talking about because "they were in the military" what they should do is be arrested for taking part in riots and violent protests. __eou__
Should the U.S. implement mandatory military service to curb the wussification of snowflakes/generation Z and bring respect back to law enforcement? Why or why not? __eou__ No, there are some people that I don't want to ever be given a firearm. __eou__
Should the U.S. implement mandatory military service to curb the wussification of snowflakes/generation Z and bring respect back to law enforcement? Why or why not? __eou__ Haha what an unbiased question. All of generation Z is about as snowflakey as your party is racist. __eou__ Well at least you understand we aren't all racists. __eou__ But you clearly don't understand that we're not all snowflakes. __eou__ No, you are. You're just too young to see it __eou__ Wow. I am blown away. I feel like I don't need to tell you why you're hypocritical and wrong. You already know it. __eou__

What weird phobias do you have and what caused your irrational fear? __eou__ Escalators. Witnessed a teenage girl get her foot shredded at the top cause she wasn't paying attention __eou__ That would have scared me too. __eou__
What weird phobias do you have and what caused your irrational fear? __eou__ Escalators. Witnessed a teenage girl get her foot shredded at the top cause she wasn't paying attention __eou__ I get anxious when riding on escalators and walking up stairs and I think watching my mother caused it (not sure if that's possible). She would rather get on the elevator than go up the escalator or stairs, and she gets nervous walking up stairs. I don't remember having these problems when I was younger. __eou__
What weird phobias do you have and what caused your irrational fear? __eou__ I don't know that it has a technical name but I have an irrational fear of speaking to people that I can't see. I truly have no idea what caused it. __eou__ I have trouble speaking on the phone too. I have to write a script pretty much when I make phonecalls and if the conversation doesn't go the way I planned I have a panic attack. __eou__ I used to be like this as well. I was forced to overcome it as my job requires me to make a lot of calls, but I totally understand the feeling. __eou__

What weird phobias do you have and what caused your irrational fear? __eou__ Unfortunately, I have autophobia, which is the fear of being abandoned. I'm afraid of losing everyone, because in 7th grade, I was considered an outcast by my classmates and I wasn't able to see my friends during the school day. I seriously felt unwanted and afraid. It was one thing that triggered my paranoia, although many other things have influenced it. __eou__ That would be really tough. __eou__
What weird phobias do you have and what caused your irrational fear? __eou__ I've taken flights all over the world and I love traveling but it's extremely emotionally taxing for me. I have to have a couple of drinks at the airport bar, continue to drink on the plane, hopefully fall asleep for the duration of the flight and listen to powerful motivational music on headphones during take off and landing. I just can't handle my inner voices telling me the plane is going to crash or be sabotaged by a terrorist attack or whatever. __eou__
What weird phobias do you have and what caused your irrational fear? __eou__ Rodents because of my sister __eou__

What is the worst dentistry-related story you know? __eou__ When I was a kid we had a dentist we would visit regularly for checkups. He was always friendly and lively. Would always say that my teeth were looking great and that was that. At a certain point we were informed the practice was closing because they couldn't find the dentist anymore. Turned out he was a raging alcohol and usually worked drunk. I probably never noticed because I either had no clue or due to the mouthguard. As it later turned out.. my teeth were far from fine, he was just drunk all the time. __eou__
What is the worst dentistry-related story you know? __eou__ I got a good one, but it's on a dog :) Usually all of our general anesthetics are done in the morning. This gives the pet the rest of the day to recover and have a final exam before they go home. ANYWAY, at about 3:00pm we had a dog come in. It wasn't a walk in, we knew he was coming, but he had booked the appointment that morning. When he booked it, he said that the dogs 'has blood on his nose'. We assume there is a laceration or something on the nose, but no the blood was coming from the inside of the nose...and was arterial blood (as opposed to venous blood, meaning coming from an artery rather then a vein). Normally you never see arterial blood...surgeons avoid arteries like the plague 'cause an animal can bleed out fast from a puncture in an artery. We also see that this dog's teeth are TERRIBLE! So we take him into dentistry right away. We pull all sorts of junk from this poor dog's sinus...hair mostly, but plaque and tartar and food as well. The dog lost all of his (remaining) teeth, but the 15 year old Beagle left the clinic the next day acting like a puppy. It was awesome! __eou__

I know a lot of girls who believe theyve never had an orgasm. Is this a common feeling among women? __eou__ I was that woman up until a couple years ago. I can tell you that imo the issue is that many women are subconsciously socialized to believe that self pleasure is bad, strange or all of the above. Women masturbating is more taboo than men's masturbation and as a result many women don't get off til later. Plus there's the whole thing with most of us needing clitoral stimulation to get off. Movies and tv makes it look like we should be climaxing with just the tip in. Unfortunately that's not really the case. __eou__
I know a lot of girls who believe theyve never had an orgasm. Is this a common feeling among women? __eou__ Are you sure they're not saying they've never had an orgasm from penetration alone? Because there's no way a person doesn't know if they've never had one. __eou__

At school was pulling a 400 pound laptop cart behind me (not pushing because the building was being renovated and I had to navigate through construction and remodeling materials) and as the cart gained momentum it sped up and the back of my ankle got caught under it.

Guys and Gals who are single and game: How much casual sex actually happens? __eou__ Zilch. I need to get out more. __eou__ "and game" though __eou__
Guys and Gals who are single and game: How much casual sex actually happens? __eou__ Zilch. I need to get out more. __eou__ Or, maybe you just prefer monogamy? :D __eou__ Yeah, I'm not a bad looking guy, and I love playing video games, but I need to at least try if I'm going to ever find somebody. __eou__ Sounds like your life doesn't expose you to a lot of new people atm. __eou__ Correct plus all coworkers are 10+ years older than me. That's about to change though __eou__ Nice. New job? Fair warning: dating people you meet through work while working with them could be described as "risky" by some. __eou__ Yeah, believe me I've been there done that haha. I'm going to be working in the field of education soon so there will be plenty of younger people fresh out of college. Where I live, 20 somethings either go to church to meet potential dates or to bars/clubs. I don't do either of those things. __eou__ Good luck! __eou__ Thanks! __eou__
Guys and Gals who are single and game: How much casual sex actually happens? __eou__ I start getting really cranky if I don't have sex for a week. __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ yup. it's been three weeks. Time to kill. __eou__
Guys and Gals who are single and game: How much casual sex actually happens? __eou__ I start getting really cranky if I don't have sex for a week. __eou__ I love this idea. "What's wrong, 'Haiku?" "Mrowmrmo no sex mrew." "Oh, no! Let's get you laid!" __eou__ hey, I'm not objecting... __eou__ "Hmmm... Tell me more about what you look for..." haha __eou__ I want a girl with a mind like a diamond I want a girl who knows what's best I want a girl with shoes that cut And eyes that burn like cigarettes __eou__ [removed] __eou__
Guys and Gals who are single and game: How much casual sex actually happens? __eou__ I mean, as much as you want depending on your bank account and standards. __eou__
Guys and Gals who are single and game: How much casual sex actually happens? __eou__ Not me, it my single girl friend who is 27 and has been single for 3 years (after a 2-3 year relationship) takes home a different guy like every/every other weekend. Also has two constant guys and is always juggling between them. The two constants last around a month or two before they lose connection and then they get replaced by whatever one night stand she managed to stay in touch with. It's so weird. She is WAY more promiscuous than when we were in college 5-7 years ago. __eou__ As a guy, if I found out about this being in my gf's history, that would be a major turnoff. Just fyi. __eou__ Yeah I wonder how she's gonna find anyone sometimes. She's so funny and charismatic and can obviously pull tail...but who will want to stay with her at age 27 if they are aware she'll sleep with you the first night you meet? College is different because sometimes when you know you wanna get laid that's what is happening. But age 27 is the time to like tone it down lol. She was on Tinder and didn't sleep with many people because she didn't like the way the app was so she deleted it and is like 5x more promiscuous. __eou__ Even doing it in college is kind of yuck to me. Once or twice, maybe (personal taste). I'm all for equality, but that means, to me, that someone like your friend deserves to be with a guy who also has a massive list of conquests, so to speak. __eou__ Honestly, I have to wonder if this is your friend's reaction to some sort of trauma from that relationship you mentioned. It's possible that a break could do her some good. __eou__
Guys and Gals who are single and game: How much casual sex actually happens? __eou__ About as much as I want, really. As a woman sex seems pretty easy to find, especially if you don't have ridiculously high standards. I don't consider myself very attractive, I'm overweight, but I still do alright. The biggest problem is finding a casual sex partner that I'm not afraid will either murder me or give me an STD. I don't go looking very often just for those reasons. __eou__ &gt;The biggest problem is finding a casual sex partner that I'm not afraid will either murder me or give me an STD.

What piece of advice have you been given that you wish you never heard? __eou__ when my parents told me that boys/men will tell you that they love you just to get you into bed, so not to ever trust what they say. Set me up for failure in trusting men in a relationships, took me many years to undo this one. __eou__ incredible.So how did they meet then? __eou__ oh they were both rather promiscuous if you catch my drift, my mom was married to my bio father, dating a man and sleeping with my step dad, they eventually married and became super religious. so I am sure it came from a good place but it messed with my head. for the longest time I thought men never actually loved women they only loved the sex. __eou__ woah.congrats for changing your view with something you believe is more comforting and logical in your eyes __eou__

Why do some people doubt being transgender is real, but have no problem believing in religion? __eou__ Because reasonable thinking is not a thing that religious people typically do. Just like how they believe that every single god doesn't exist except for their own. __eou__

The facts are that you currently can't prove the existence of god, not that there isnt one. __eou__

Food/service employees of reddit, what was a time where a customer told you "I'm never coming back here again"? __eou__ I have a wild one. When I was 16, A woman came in and ordered box of donuts. No biggie, get her order and everything is fine. Until our baker came out from the kitchen and she noticed he was Indian. She looks me dead in the eye and asked me if he made donuts. I told her he had, he was our baker. She acted like a child who had squished a bug in her hand. I was so taken aback by her outward display of disgust I didn't even know how to react. She took a seat in our lobby and was chatting with her friends about how she hoped the donuts weren't "tampered with". After a good ten minutes of excessive banter between her and her friends something in me snapped. I walked over as calmly as possible and asked her to leave. She started screaming and yelling, asked for my manager and my name, the works. I remained calm and went to grab my boss. I explained the situation to her and without another word she walked to the till, refunded her order, walked with me to her table and handed her the cash and told her to leave. She started screaming again and said she'd be calling our head office, and that she'd never return, nor would anyone she knew. I laughed and said "that's fine by me!" Then I stopped because I thought for sure I'd be in shit. Instead after she left with daggers in her eyes and foaming out the mouth, My boss told me I was a smartass, but she thought it was hilarious and well justified. I never got into any trouble and out head office never contacted us about it. I still work there and have yet to her her ever come back. Which is good because I've grown a bit and so has my backbone, and I'm not sure I'd be able to stop myself from calling her out for being such a hag. __eou__
Food/service employees of reddit, what was a time where a customer told you "I'm never coming back here again"? __eou__ I used to work at a UPS Store. Since they are not the post office, but provide postal services, there is a markup on the price. Just like any other retail item you might purchase at a store. Had a woman come in for a single stamp. We charged $0.49 which was a $0.07 profit for us. She threw a fit about it, got all angry about why we didn't charge face value because she *knows* how much a stamp costs. We tried explaining that because we pay full face value for stamps we add a surcharge because, you know, we're a business and need to make money. We also tried explaining that a $0.07 surcharge was acceptable to most of our customers because we provide better customer service and our wait times were much lower than at the post office. She didn't care. She ended up driving 6 miles to the nearest post office to save $0.07 because she refused to do business with people who were corrupt and stealing from their customers. __eou__
Food/service employees of reddit, what was a time where a customer told you "I'm never coming back here again"? __eou__ Guy in restaurant had just an absolute horrible time. Everything was cold, service was slow, food was all under/over cooked... anything that could have gone wrong did. At least to hear him tell it. Everyone at the table ate the meals, no one else complained. You get to recognize the look on people face when they are with "That Guy who always does this". When he asked for a gift cert so he could come back and let us make it up to him I replied with deadpan that "There is no way I would subject you to that level of injustice. I could never ask you to come back." He almost didn't take the hint till the gal, I assume was wifey, dragged him out the door. __eou__

Online Daters of Reddit: How much would recommend/stay away from OkCupid, and why? __eou__ I used OKC to hook up and actually met my girlfriend on Tinder __eou__ Cool! Yeah, so Tinder is more the "let's go out for ice cream" app, right? __eou__ Tinder should equal bang it out (did that too) OKC should be more date/relationship Ain't a perfect science __eou__ Wait... *it's not*?

Online Daters of Reddit: How much would recommend/stay away from OkCupid, and why? __eou__ OKC is the only dating site I've found that lets me block straight people from viewing my profile so I call that a plus __eou__ What happens when they see it? Messages? __eou__ You can opt out of appearing as a match for straight people and if somehow they do manage to get to your profile I think it tells them they can't view it. I also can't view straight profiles from the same setting __eou__

Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ Do you still believe in god? __eou__ [deleted] __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ Why do people do the opposite, which is far more illogical? There's no proof of the existence of God. There's plenty of proof of a biological basis for trans people. __eou__ There's no proof of either __eou__ Bu bu bu bullshit! https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/ __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ I'm out of the loop these days. What do you mean by 'transgender ideology'? __eou__ Unicorns and magic. __eou__ Well, I know what transgender means, and I know what an ideology is. But I have absolutely no idea what transgender ideology points to. If it points to unicorns and magic, I don't believe in those things. __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ I'm out of the loop these days. What do you mean by 'transgender ideology'? __eou__ 'transgender ideology' doesn't mean anything. it's another genius OP framing their question in a crap way likely because they have no intention of starting a discussion. just eager to drop an easy anti-trans post and leave it at that __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ They're both equally contrived. __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ God is too much of a drag. __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ Because I've met transgender people. Post and pre-op. I've seen them go from depressed and miserable to **happy.** I've yet to see any solid evidence of god though. __eou__ Bingo. Evidence. __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ Because I've met transgender people. Post and pre-op. I've seen them go from depressed and miserable to **happy.** I've yet to see any solid evidence of god though. __eou__ I've seen people who haven't had religion find religion and then go from miserable to **happy** __eou__ Count me as one. Conversely, I've known trans people who years later regretted their choices and they now live even more fucked up lives. __eou__ Surprise, surprise. People have differing reactions to things. I don't get the point you, and the guy above you, are trying to make. __eou__

Yeah fucking right. Try to be a bit more believable and say you've known one trans person like that next time. You're either 100% outright lying or you think you know what your trans friends are going through but you don't in reality. __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ i believe that being transgender is a mental disorder. recently, mental health is very important to society and is more commonly recognized as being a real thing. therefore, i feel that many are believing in transgender ideologies due to the large number of people that are having these identify issues. however, i personally do not know how i feel about there being a God, but i do believe that being transgender is a real thing. __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ 'transgender *ideology*' that's a new one why don't you just skip the middle man OP and say 'fuck trans people amirite??' be a little more honest with what you're trying to say __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ Because Gender Dysphoria is recognized by the DSM-5 as a disorder that's treatable by hormone replacement therapy, while the existence of God cannot be scientifically proven. The very definition of faith is belief without evidence. So they're really completely different concepts. __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ Because we have evidence that transgender people exist and that they're happier when allowed to transition. Because we have evidence that a trans man's brain is more similar to a cis man's brain than to a cis woman's brain. __eou__

Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ Define "transgender ideology," please. None of my trans friends share a common ideology other than "we have a right to be who we are" __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ Looked at OP's post history and they seem to have a serious fetish for being kicked in the balls; perhaps a latent desire to become a woman? __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ Transgender I get. Choose-your-own-adventure-alphabet-label-quit-oppressing-me-gender... I don't. That seems about as made up and snowflake-ish as the several thousand religions in the world. __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ [deleted] __eou__
Why do some people doubt the existence of god, but have no problem believing in transgender ideology? __eou__ Uh, because they're two separate things entirely? And only one of them is a thing? __eou__

What was your biggest bathroom mishap? __eou__ Thought could squeeze out fast before unbuckling to take a massive dump. I was wrong and had to go commando for the rest of the day. __eou__
What was your biggest bathroom mishap? __eou__ I was trying to get home as the roads were becoming more and more icy and traffic was horrible. I found myself literally about to piss my pants in my car. Somehow I held on until my exit and stopped at the first gas station. By this time, having to piss morphed into also having to poo. So I go inside the Chevron bathroom which is single use. Upon entering, I knew something had gone wrong. About a half inch of water was covering the floor, wet toilet paper was littered all over and the toilet itself was a mess. Being clogged already and my urges becoming a reality shortly, I began hovering and do my business. It was glorious. After cleaning up I look down at the ungodly sight that is the toilet. There's my poo on top some other persons poo...it can't flush and there's still water everywhere and I realize there's no way that when I leave the restroom that whoever is waiting to use it won't think I made this monstrosity. I open the door and 3 people are waiting. I say maybe the worst thing I could've said by saying, "It wasn't me" and I leave as quickly as humanly possible. __eou__
If you could talk to them one more time, what would you say? __eou__ To my gram, who passed away last year. Id tell her i love her and will never forget her face or her voice or her lessons. __eou__
If you could talk to them one more time, what would you say? __eou__ I would ask him (my dad who was killed when I was 3) to tell me about his life and about how he fell in love with mom. I would also want to know about what exactly happened the day he died. __eou__

Theists of Reddit, why do you still believe in a god? __eou__ I'm not a theist, but my father is. He believes in science 100%, evolution, the big bang, etc- but he also believes in God. I asked him one time how he could be so on board with science and still believe in a god, and he said something along the lines of. "They say the Big Bang created the universe, and I believe that. But explain to me how one minute there was nothing, and the next a huge blast of energy. Where did that energy come from? Science can't explain that, and when science stops explaining things, thats when religion has to." __eou__ God that old line __eou__

Theists of Reddit, why do you still believe in a god? __eou__ Humans are spiritual beings. Praying is just another form of meditation. Church is like comfort food for the soul. So people will away believe. Plus, reality is too difficult to understand, for so humans. __eou__
Theists of Reddit, why do you still believe in a god? __eou__ Because it feels right. Because I see the effect that my faith has had on my life, and I don't believe that it's just coincidence. Sure, random chance happens, but sometimes... things just lines up too well. I also have full faith in science, believe in evolution, all that stuff. But I just think God gave us the ability to think and discover the world around us so we can understand how He works. __eou__

After knowing you for so long, I never thought I would see the day where you would leave me in an egotistical fashion. Sometimes I hate you because you broke my heart. But I still care about you, because you were my best friend, before "us" ever existed. I wish that we were still friends, but you decided that I'm not worth speaking to or mentioning.

Fuck you for being so fat and not caring to lose weight, eat right, or exercise even though your dad died from diabetes/being overweight. Fuck you for asking me to buy you a car (despite your lack of job). Fuck you for never paying me back for any of your bills I paid. Fuck you for telling me seeing my family wasn't important. Fuck you for telling me my sister was hot. Fuck you for calling me fat (i wasn't fat then, nor am I now). Fuck you for never helping me carry the groceries up 2 flights of stairs. Fuck you for saying I couldn't talk to a guy I work with. Fuck you for invading my privacy constantly. And most of all, fuck myself for actually staying with you for well over a year. __eou__

Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ Glad I got that out of the way __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ Either choke on my cock or go away. I don't need your bullshit right now. __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ At the time, I considered cheating one of the worst things you could do to a partner. But now that's actually a big turn on, and I really wouldn't mind if you slept with Tyhrone. __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ How goes your non-existence? Not that I broke up with you yet, but you never existed on the first place. __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ Hey, hope things are going well! __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ I'm sorry. I know I can't fix my schizophrenia, I know I won't really ever be who you loved. Every night I wake up and I dreamt of you. They say you shouldn't focus on the past but I've tried so hard to let go. My psyche won't let me. I'm ready to die SS. If I did would you even know? I've just deteriorated so far from who I was. I don't know what else to say __eou__

Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ Hope you cut down on the heroin. __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ I'm the type of person that thinks bad decisions shouldn't be cause for regret, that there's always something we can learn from them. Then I met you. Fuck you so much, I hope you die alone and in pain. __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ My bad I cheated on you. Thanks for you emotional and fiscal support during our relationship. Sorry for being a douche bag. Glad your life has turned out great. __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ I hated you when you cheated and the only thing I missed about you was the crazy blow jobs and letting me drain my sack in your ass all the time; you were a great whore. __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ I'm sorry, I truly am sorry. You going abroad for a month was a learning experience to me, just as much as it was for you. I shouldn't have wanted you to check in every day to know if you were safe. I can see now that that was controlling. I'm not asking for a second chance, you deserve better. I hope, I genuinely hope you can find someone that's better than I was. You deserve it, you deserve the entire world. Even though you didn't know what you wanted when we were together, you'll find it. You and your twin sister. When were older I want you to be as rich as possible, I want you to succeed, you will. You still mean the world to me and I hope nothing but the best for you and you sister. I will always support you in whatever way I can. I was driving by your university and saw you, I thought about stopping and "running into you" to tell you all of this and I want you to forgive me, but you shouldn't. I got controlling when you went abroad and you shouldn't forgive me. I could apologize a million and one times and I wouldn't expect you to accept it. But truly, I am sorry, you'll always be special to me, even if I have a new girlfriend that I love, Ill always love you, not in the sense that I'd date you again, I wouldn't, you deserve better. Love as in you'll always be special to me. You were the first person I truly loved and you'll always have a special place in my heart. __eou__

Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ I wish we never met, really. What was puppy love for you, meant much more to me.The only good things from the relationship are a couple bands you introduced me to and the camping trips I planned all by myself (your welcome). I hope you grow up, but it's doubtful. I hope you get your life together. I hope you at some point realize that you cant blame everything wrong in your life on everybody else. I also hope you acknowledge your own faults and stop thinking you are above others. You are the reason you are unhappy. I tried everything to make you happy but could no longer deal with it affecting my well being. I can't burn myself to keep you warm. I'm glad I kicked you out, you were incredibly toxic to yourself and to me. Bye Felisha __eou__

Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ It probably was my fault, but I don't miss it now. Also, stop talking about your damn bicycles. __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ I'm sorry but your penis is small. Like, really small. Like a thumb but with less dexterity. I never wanted to say it to your face because I am the *bigger* person. __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ Nothing __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ Ex #1 - Please stop PM'ing me to wish me a happy birthday on Facebook, it makes shit awkward, like you're trying to hide something. Just write on my wall like a normal person. Ex #2 - What's up with posting all this shit that you know I'd find funny? Like, I got a horse, now you post tons of horse-related things? Little creepy. __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ You went out with me because of death treats, but you didn't seem stressed, you look like you enjoyed it. I wish you could have trusted me, I still love you. I am your match and you are my match, so wake the FUCK up and stop talking about how you can't find anyone in front of me!!!! __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ Thanks for putting me back together. __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ You were so hot and your tits were epic. That's about it though... good luck __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ I'm sorry that I couldn't be the thing that held your entire life together: I had my own emotional problems and I couldn't be expected to fix both of us. Also people don't want to help you when you act like you've got everything figured out when you're 20 and act like a condescending prick when anyone suggests that you might want a fallback if your "I'll be a chemistry professor" endgame doesn't work out perfectly. __eou__
Hi it's me your ex, what do you want to tell me? __eou__ I'm sorry you're completely incapable of displaying any emotion aside from anger, frustration and overall anxiety. I'm sorry you decided to talk exclusively to one or two select individuals instead of me about how I made you feel during this relationship before deciding to end it on Valentine's Day. I'm sorry I got you pregnant early in our relationship and had to see the look on your face that basically said "oh fuck my life is over" and then have to see that seems facial expression every fucking day for the next 2 years. I'm sorry I wasn't home with you all that much while I was busy busting my ass with an insurance company to make enough money to support you and our beautiful child. I'm sorry I didn't come to bed with you so early in my evening after work because you had to get up at 4AM to go work minimum wage and spent my nights playing Counter Strike instead of cuddling you while being suffocated by your hair in my sleep. I'm sorry you said that you didn't like having your picture taken; as an owner of a DSLR, that fucking sucks because you're so gorgeous. I'm sorry I only remembered how gorgeous you actually are after you broke up with me because I was being so fucking ignorant and consumed by our awful non-stop daily routine and we didn't make eye contact with each other. I'm sorry you don't make eye contact with me since the day our baby was born. I'm sorry you pushed me away that night when the baby was crying and you were crying and yelling at her to shut up and I had to lay in bed hearing you both cry because you told me to go back to bed. I'm sorry my heart turned to stone that night. I'm sorry that this fucking garbage awful apartment sucks and it looks terrible and that's been a huge contribution to your negative attitude. I'm sorry we picked this place. I'm sorry I met you during a really bad part of my life, but holy shit you lit my heart on fire since the moment I met you. I'm sorry we rushed our relationship and had such amazing sex, and all that went out the window after the baby was born. I'm sorry we started looking away from each other instead of to each other. I'm sorry that my life has been so all about video games since I was like 3, but it's hard to let go of something that's been around all my life and replace it entirely. I'm sorry I'm such a grown child. I'm sorry that we didn't own a car for the first year of our baby's life and while you were pregnant, I'm sorry we had to walk everywhere. I'm sorry I didn't give you the 10% of my emotional energy that remained at the end of my workday, but a man doesn't want to feel like 10% of himself around his woman. I'm sorry you didn't give me a serious reality check before making your own decision to tear our new family apart. I'm sorry you've become so detached from me emotionally and from yourself, but all it took was to sit with each other and talk about our feelings, which I didn't do because you've become completely unapproachable. I'm sorry you roll your eyes at everything you don't want to hear or you disagree with and I'm sorry that I have to be interrupted and contested by you while speaking. I'm sorry that all you want in life is to sit at home and smoke weed in silence, sorry that having a baby wasn't enough to tell you to wake up and change your mindset at 23. I'm sorry your friend is such a stuck up bitch (her boyfriend is okay though, he cares for her well). I'm sorry the new neighbors upstairs from our shitty basement apartment are an obnoxious zoo of people BUT AT LEAST THEY'RE HAPPY AND TOGETHER AS A FAMILY YOU FUCKING BITCH. I'm sorry I convinced you to cut off your beautiful hair, that was dumb; it was so beautiful and I think a part of you changed after it was gone and you resent me for it. I'm sorry you resent me because I got you pregnant. I'm sorry I didn't remind you that you mean the world to me, but I guess my actions (or lack thereof) have spoken louder than any words. I'm sorry our sex life has been so inadequate lately, you look smoking hot since you lost your baby weight. I'm sorry I want to fuck your brains out right now, but I feel like your brains are being fucked out by someone else since YOU TREAT ME LIKE A FUCKING FLY ON THE WALL WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? I'M SORRY YOU'RE FUCKING DEAD INSIDE MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PHILOSOPHY OF BUDDHISM BEFORE ANY MORE YOGA. I'm sorry I've lost my own Buddhist ways and haven't been keeping up with who I'm supposed to be; I'm just so emotionally drained after spending the past year securing ourselves financially. I'm sorry we're always broke why the fuck are we always broke? I'm sorry we've spent the past two years living paycheck to paycheck, but you know what, things could be a WHOLE LOT WORSE for you right now. I'm sorry this feels like "stay together for the kid" and that it feels like we're just roommates, maybe you should have FUCKING SAID SOMETHING TO ME. I'm sorry you didn't wake me up from my bad dream that was the status of our relationship instead of just breaking things off. I'm sorry that the your relationship with your mother is so awful, maybe that's something you should put on your list of things you need to deal with before you can progress in your life. I'm sorry you're so agnostic. I'm sorry you're so lazy that you haven't managed to throw a single cardboard roll at the end of a roll of toilet paper into the garbage in like six months. I'm sorry that the way you do dishes is unquestionably the worst thing I've consistently seen from someone. You're supposed to fill the sink with water and some soap, not run the tap for 10 minutes and throw everything into the dish rack while everything is still dirty, fuck, come on dude. I'm sorry that all these things have made me less of a kind person and that we've both spent the past two years building all of this up inside ourselves until one of us just breaks, that's not how I wanted our relationship to go down. I'm sorry that someday you'll have to explain to our child why mommy doesn't love daddy and I'll have to hear it from their mouth instead of yours. I'm sorry that you think separating our family is so fucking easy for you, but I guess that's what happens to someone who grew up without knowing who their own father is. I'm sorry I have to think about you intertwining your soul with someone else, instead of the way we used to. I'm sorry you're leaving this relationship with the hopes that you'll actually be able to save up for your own car and apartment on a part-time minimum wage job in the next two months. I'm sorry that I have to keep living with you in this shitty shithole for awhile while you completely and deliberately do everything you can to not look at me and ignore me in my own home. I'm sorry you're such a shithead because you started smoking at 12 and moved away from your mom at 15, you say it like you were cool for doing it or something, how deplorable. I'm sorry you think that I'm over-thinking this break up when you're fortifying your emotional walls to keep me out, but thinking by myself is the only thing left when I'm alone watching Netflix while you sleep on the couch like a dog. I'm sorry that I have an IQ of 140 or something like that, I think that the chronic weed-smoking is holding me back lately. I'm sorry that you refuse to change your attitude even slightly in this relationship; I'm not sure if it's 'can't', or 'won't' with you. I'm sorry that I feel like I don't know anything about you anymore, maybe that will make things easier for me in the long run. I'm sorry that our kid is so fucking special, that will make things harder for me in the long run. I'm sorry that we won't get to travel anywhere together, but it's okay, I'll save my money for someone who cares. __eou__

do you think the drinking age should be changed? if so, what age do you think? __eou__ 12 years old. Weed out the fools through their own indulgence. __eou__
do you think the drinking age should be changed? if so, what age do you think? __eou__ lowered to 16 - germany and luxembourg seem to cope fine __eou__
do you think the drinking age should be changed? if so, what age do you think? __eou__ I believe 21 is too high. In my country it is 18 and we have no problem with that. It's a nice, nearly universal number, so I don't see a reason it shouldn't be the one used in the US. But deep down I think that it should be up to the states. I agree with Justice O'Connor's dissent in South Carolina v. Dole that argued that the National Drinking Age Act of 1984 is unconstitutional. __eou__ Honestly, I don't know what country you live in but it's probably as a whole more mature than the US. 21 SHOULD be thought of as too high for the US but these fuckin kids... Not even ready at 21 most the time. __eou__ By my experience people will drink whether the law permits them or not. Having a high drinking age prevents responsible people from drinking responsibly in safe environments (like drinking a good beer at a German restaurant) but will do nothing to prevent irresponsible people from binge drinking. __eou__ You're 100% right.. But I don't think an 18 year old is mature enough to drink responsibly. __eou__

Not even ready at 21 most the time. __eou__ I think a big reason that a lot of 21 year olds don't seem ready to drink is BECAUSE the drinking age is 21. We're not taught to drink safely. People turn 18 and start drinking regardless of the law, and due to its illegality it leads to bad decisions and practices. If we reduced it to the age when people are normally getting into college and drinking culture anyway, it would be a lot easier to learn to drink safely due to the lack of negative repercussions legally __eou__

What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ Looking forward to the future.

What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ Simply put, the knowledge that it isn't pointless. It may FEEL that way at the time, but I know better than to trust my feelings a lot of the time. Life is beautiful, it really is. When one door closes another opens. You have to go through darkness to see the light. Etc etc etc. it's drenched in cliché but it's true. Try focusing on the small, joyous things you experience every day and you may feel that life isn't as pointless as it seems. __eou__ [deleted] __eou__
What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ I think for me it's the thought that this is my one time experiencing this consciousness. On a timeline my existence is millions of years of nothing, followed by a a fleeting consciousness, followed by unending blackness again. So while I'm here, no matter how miserable it is, i want to experience it. Edit: missed a word __eou__ ayup. it's all you've got, might as well keep it. __eou__

What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ If I gave up, I have the feeling other people would think they had it right. I keep going to prove them wrong. __eou__
What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ The knowledge that I've felt this before, and knowing that it has also passed. __eou__
What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ My kids. They need me to be a badass superwoman, no matter how ridiculous things are. __eou__
What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ Knowing that life is a mystery. You have complete free will to explore life as you wish. You create your own path and don't have to rely on fate or chance or luck. Why would you want to end that? It's true, an illness, accident, etc., can throw a wrench into your plans. But your control means you can fight thru it all. You can't ever regret something if you at least tried it. __eou__

What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ Work - most days gets me out of bed, but I know they'd move on and manage without me. Somehow. Family - it'd be devastating to lose me, but again they'd muddle through and get on with life just like after our mom died. Dogs - they'd be fucked. I'd better stick around for them. __eou__
What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ I was listening to the Eminem song today..."sometimes I feel like the world is on my shoulders" and it hit home. The song is also about his daughter and that he does it all for her. I feel the same way about my kids. __eou__
What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ If life seems pointless, it is because I haven't assigned a purpose to myself. And even that can be a conscious choice that I can enjoy; simply existing without needing to do anything. Right now my purpose is to eat a grilled cheese sandwich so I can keep living without feeling uncomfortably hungry. On a slightly larger scale, my purpose is to help meet the needs of my family. On a grand scale, my purpose is to marginally improve the lives of a few people that happen to exist at the same time and in the same general place as me. On an infinite scale, my purpose is to be a fleeting speck in the universe. But that total perspective vortex isn't super relevant to how I experience things. __eou__

What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ My kids. Yes, life sucks and it is stressful. But it would be even more so for them if they were stuck with their Dad until they grew up. So I stay alive and fighting for them. __eou__
What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ Knowing if I killed myself, I would not get a chance at eternal life and peace on earth with no pain and suffering after Armageddon. Also, alcohol helps. __eou__
What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ Give yourself a reward for getting through the day like "If I get through today and get minimal work done I can play a few hours of Stardew Valley." __eou__
What keeps you moving on when all you want to do is give up because life is pointless? __eou__ How is life pointless? If there is a judge here, you're it. I choose joy to transcend sad and happy. "If nothing we do matters, then all that matters is what we do." --Angel. __eou__

That's obviously a red flag. __eou__ But I'm not even a flag user?! __eou__ You don't own a flag? It's 2017, you monster! Go buy a flag because not using flags is an obvious red flag. __eou__ I'm not drinking your koolade, dude. Not even once. __eou__

Parents if you could have app that allows you to be in contact with your child's teacher what other things would you want to be included in the app(Ex; link school events to google calendars)? __eou__ We use the remind app for all assignments and due dates along with any special events and random information. A science teacher posted something in remind this evening with a link about current weather (severe weather/tornadoes). Not anything that is due or required...just a "I think this is cool, check it out" thing. Some teachers have remind but only post once a year. That's not helpful. One teacher will post every day. Some days it's "no homework". I really appreciate the daily remind messages. __eou__

Why are mods allowed to bully others on reddit? __eou__ If your feelings are hurt, complain to the admins and see what they tell you. AskReddit isn't the right place for this. __eou__ My feelings are not hurt, I have known this about reddit for a long time. Just surprised that it is deemed as an ok behaviour. __eou__ It's their only power in their lives, so instead of being successful in the real world, they think themselves Supermen in the virtual one. __eou__ I know, just thought that this should be controlled on a bigger site like reddit? __eou__
Why are mods allowed to bully others on reddit? __eou__ I love how these are always vague and non specific. __eou__

Why are mods allowed to bully others on reddit? __eou__ I'm a mod. I'm often accused of "being a bully" because I am enforcing a clear violation of a clearly posted rule. If that's the sort of behavior you're talking about, that's not bullying and you may need to find a different subreddit with different rules. I've never encountered any actual bullying of users by mods either as a user or as a mod. We generally try really hard to be polite and detached even when users are telling us they hope we die of "cunt cancer" after being raped by our own fathers. __eou__ You should meet your swedish counterparts then, they do as they please and will attack anyone that they do not agree with. I used to official statistics from the swedish government and asked what people thought of it and got shut down, called a troll, nazi and racist. __eou__

Most people of royalty in European Kingdom have had some incestuous relationship, sometimes even married one. It is quite common a few hundred years ago as people are usually stuck in a village or town and few if any would travel outside of their town as they weren't able to secure work to feed their families. __eou__

What is concerning about a potential relationship between Trump and Putin? __eou__ We aren't concerned that they're friends - that they like to play golf together and have long gossippy conversations late at night. We're concerned that Putin is manipulating Trump to essentially turn America into a servant of Russia. We have an increasing amount of evidence that this is the case, as well as evidence that he's doing the same thing in other countries all over the world. We know this is something he does. We know he's deeply corrupt and we also know that he used to be a KGB spy. None of this is conspiracy. This is all common, accepted knowledge worldwide. I don't know about you, but I find that to be pretty concerning. __eou__ So please play this out for me to help me understand. What happens between step 1 and 5? generally speaking.. obviously there are not 5 steps to this plan 1) Trump befriends Putin 2)? 3)? 4)? 5) America is Russia's servant And what does America being Russia's servant entail? EDIT: Formatting EDIT: you said servant, not slave __eou__
What is concerning about a potential relationship between Trump and Putin? __eou__ Putin is not looking to "make deals" with America that come out good for both parties, he wants to increase Russia's influence and power by weakening America and its European allies. This is not a "rising tide lifts all ships" situation. He wants to diminish American influence, disrupt Europe and NATO, increase Europe's reliance on Russian oil, and expand territory he believes is rightfully Russia's. He believes that the greatest tragedy of the 20th century was the fall of the USSR, and I believe he would like to see that corrected, at least in broad strokes, before he dies. I don't trust Trump enough to understand any of that. To him, Putin is just another guy to "make deals" with, whatever the fuck that means, and whatever it costs the US beyond the next financial year. Be cordial, keep dialogue going, whatever, but don't trust them in good faith. __eou__ What you're saying is that Trump is going to make poor business deals with Putin and put America in a worse situation? It's one thing to not trust his political savvy, but wouldn't it be odd to think that as a successful businessman he understands business and economics less than any prior president? If not that, then I don't understand the chain of events leading to Russia weakening the United states. Again, I ask if you could play it out. Walk me through the chain of events leading to Russia weakening the United states __eou__ &gt; What you're saying is that Trump is going to make poor business deals with Putin and put America in a worse situation? Read it again and pay attention, if you're actually interested in a discussion and not just here to bait arguments. __eou__ I'm just asking for someone to play out a scenario, any scenario, where Trump+Putin leads to a bad thing for the United States. My whole point is that I hear so much about how Trump is Putin's puppet, and that it will lead to bad things. But nobody can generate any kind of scenario or chain of events where it ends in something negative for the United States edit: I apologize, my comment was baiting a little. But the point that I'm trying to reach is that my question is about "playing it out". What is the scenario or chain of events? I'm not an unreasonable person. I concede to a fair point. But from what I've seen, there's nothing tangible here __eou__
What is concerning about a potential relationship between Trump and Putin? __eou__ I've noticed a trend among this, and many other (trump is hitler, etc.) arguments. The argument tends to fall apart as soon as you ask to play out a scenario. There's nothing there. What is the chain of events that leads from X (election) to Y (terrible conclusion). And I'm not asking for someone to tell the future, but just play out ONE possible/potential/hypothetical scenario. I'm likely to be swayed if I see someone say how it happens, but until then I can't be convinced. I don't think that's unreasonable __eou__
What's a good bathroom/shower cleaner that gets the job done and doesnt make you feel like you're dying from inhaling to much bleach? __eou__ Vinegar and baking soda, not just for volcanoes any more. __eou__ Will that kill mold? I live in an apartment and there are no windows or other natural light in the bathroom so... every few weeks, pink/orange/brown/black mold everywhere! __eou__ There are specific cleaners for mold, I suggest you go with scrubbing bubbles or one that suppresses mold. __eou__ My mom came over to check the place out (recently moved) and said I should fill the tub a little, mix some bleach in there, and then scrub the shower walls. = Can you link me an amazon product I could order to take care of the mold? It's growing mostly on the hard porcelain-esque surfaces, but also some on the plastic curtain. I would most appreciate a product name, stranger :) __eou__ [removed] __eou__
What's a good bathroom/shower cleaner that gets the job done and doesnt make you feel like you're dying from inhaling to much bleach? __eou__ Dr. Bronner's. Also get something mildly abrasive to scrub with. Not steel wool because that will scratch everything, but something like scouring pads or sponges with a good rough abrasive side. __eou__

How is an iPhone screen so crisp when its only 1080p? __eou__ Pixel density __eou__
How is an iPhone screen so crisp when its only 1080p? __eou__ Because the pixels are small __eou__ 1,920x1,200 So why can I see the pixels in any other non apple lcd? __eou__
How is an iPhone screen so crisp when its only 1080p? __eou__ Steve jobs took that to the grave. __eou__ Steve Jobs... I believe he had a better invision of the Apple product always wonder how the would be designed today if he were still with us __eou__ Phones wouldn't be getting bigger I'm sure. I have an iPhone 5 because I hate bigger phone. That's also why I say fuck androids. __eou__ Lol android is a shitty name and the do it all by themselves. Anyway everyone loves the iPhone 5. And I'll have to say being an iphone tech 2 I rarely ever see the 5 model come through for a repair and if it does its always repairable anything below it is about the same but all the new iPhones oh god.... Never felt so bad for an electronic. Never seen so much destruction in my life. __eou__ It's why I buy used phones. Because it's cheaper and half they time they work fine. The only issue I got with mine is that the buttons to turn on the screen don't always work so you just gotta press it repeatedly until the phone catches up. Seeing as you're a tech, can that be fixed? __eou__ Need a replacement. And it's easier said than done. Replacing the charge port is easier than the lock button. I don't know if you would want a refurbished phone after you see how it's done lol all kinds of stuff could be missing on the inside.. Like connector covers missing so when you drop it they come loose and you can no longer see your screen or the classic where the person who put it back together didn't put new battery tape down they just ripped the old battery out (instead of pulling the strips out like they were designed) and the new battery stuck at the time so they gave it the go ahead for quality control lmao. So now you walk around with this iPhone that looks new but eventually there's something rattling around in there like a ticking time bomb haha.

What are you doing with your life? __eou__ Wasting it, wishing I had made more choices for myself, better choices. Blaming others for my short-comings. Putting on a facade every day, seeing them go by, one after after another. __eou__
What are you doing with your life? __eou__ Waiting... Basically I'm waiting to hear back from the university I applied to for Graduate School. Basically, if I get in, I pursue my masters.

Why are people asking the same questions over and over? __eou__ Because it's hard to be original when everything has been asked. Also for the chance that a newcomer can reply rather than have an amazing story and never be able to tell it because the thread has been archived. __eou__
Why are people asking the same questions over and over? __eou__ Great minds think alike? __eou__
Why are people asking the same questions over and over? __eou__ Welcome to Reddit __eou__
Why are people asking the same questions over and over? __eou__ * People don't realise it was asked before * People imagine that after a period it is OK to ask it again as the responses will be from a different bunch / new Redditors * People lack originality and, seeking karma, repost something that was popular before __eou__
Why are people asking the same questions over and over? __eou__ To trigger lots of people who feel offeneded by it. It's one of many different types of trolling. __eou__

Who did you vote for and has your stance shifted since the election? __eou__ If I lived in a battleground state, I would have voted for Hillary, but inasmuch as my state of New York was called for Hillary with 1% reporting, I wrote in Sanders. My stance has not shifted an iota. __eou__
Who did you vote for and has your stance shifted since the election? __eou__ &gt;Who did you vote for Trump. &gt; and has your stance shifted since the election? Nope. Still a Liberal. =) __eou__
Who did you vote for and has your stance shifted since the election? __eou__ Trump and no. I knew what I was getting into. __eou__
Who did you vote for and has your stance shifted since the election? __eou__ Since the election was Bernie free, I voted for Gary Johnson. It costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to put a third party on the ballot, per state. But in states where a party has previously garnered 5% of the popular vote, that fee is waived in future elections. I felt that the Libertarian party had a better chance of accomplishing that than the Green party did, in my state. __eou__
How will the current issues of "fake news" impact the way we record history? Who gets final say as to what we teach future generations? Has fake news ever existed in history to the scale it is today? __eou__ The truth eventually becomes apparent. Nothing (that we know of) matters on a historical scale yet.

How will the current issues of "fake news" impact the way we record history? Who gets final say as to what we teach future generations? Has fake news ever existed in history to the scale it is today? __eou__ Yellow journalism has existed for a long time. But this kind of narrative-based journalism is relatively new. I think the next frontier of journalism is raw information dumps ala Wikileaks: things that don't contain a narrative and that leave you to come to your own conclusions. __eou__
How will the current issues of "fake news" impact the way we record history? Who gets final say as to what we teach future generations? Has fake news ever existed in history to the scale it is today? __eou__ I think we're memeing hard enough for it to avoid any damage to history. __eou__

What is your motivation in life? __eou__ The quest for a hug. It's been 2646.25 days. __eou__ *hugs* __eou__ Haha, I appreciate the thought, but I have to decline. Due to various circumstances, hugs are intimate for me, so I could never take a casual hug. __eou__
What is your motivation in life? __eou__ Right now, I'm clinging to the thought that my absence would mean something rather than expecting that my presence on earth has some meaning.

What type of person is the "oh, god, not that guy/girl" within your hobby? __eou__ Guy with the Nikon D4 in full-auto. Edit: It doesn't actually make me that angry when beginners spend a load of money on a camera they don't know how to use- it's your money, spend it on whatever you like. It just bothers me when they think they're way better than you just because they have a $6,000 dollar camera, when in reality my photos and video will look just as good, if not better than anything could take on that camera. __eou__

Which super power would you pick, invisibility or teleportation? Why? __eou__ Invisibility so that I can prank people without them knowing. If I have teleportation, I will get even fatter. __eou__
Which super power would you pick, invisibility or teleportation? Why? __eou__ Teleportation. I feel like it'd be infinitely more useful, especially if I could travel with people by holding their hands. __eou__
Which super power would you pick, invisibility or teleportation? Why? __eou__ Teleportation. You could go anywhere without a trace of you. Why spend thousands of dollars on a flight or boat trip when you can just go wherever the fuck you'd like? Plus, it could get you out of trouble faster than invisibility. __eou__
Which super power would you pick, invisibility or teleportation? Why? __eou__ Teleportation, just so I could see the world, or have a late night fast food run without any one knowing. __eou__

What's the stupidest thing you got in parental trouble for as a kid? __eou__ Kissing another girl... __eou__
What's the stupidest thing you got in parental trouble for as a kid? __eou__ Grade 7 or 8. Going to an opposite-sex friends house (driven there by father, father advised friend's mother wasn't home from work yet) and *not* calling for a pickup at some unspecified point later when friend's mother was late. Grounded, in part because I refused to apologise until told why it was wrong (obviously there was a suspicion of hanky panky, but my parents wouldn't say that, possibly because they knew how stupid it was, in context). __eou__
What's the stupidest thing you got in parental trouble for as a kid? __eou__ not being able to swallow pills. __eou__

Why is it unhealthy to lose 3-4 lbs a week? __eou__ It's not as long as you have a good diet, which means enough protein and vitamins. But to lose 3-4 pounds per week means you are exercising... not just starving your body, forcing it to consume muscle for protein, and fat for energy. __eou__
Why is it unhealthy to lose 3-4 lbs a week? __eou__ Not if you weight 300-400 lbs. but if you're first starting out, that might be a lot of water weight. __eou__
Why is it unhealthy to lose 3-4 lbs a week? __eou__ So if your body loses a just a little weight (experiences a small calorie deficit), it's no big deal. It happens. Your body knows this, so it will be more inclined to use fat to make up for the deficit. Your body tends to likes muscle tissue for obvious reasons. However, if you lose 3-4 pounds a week, that's a huge red flag for your body. Your body starts thinking "whoa.....that's a BIG deficit. What's going on? Food must be scarce. I should go into survival mode just in case things get worse." And so since it's all about survival now, your body will stop discriminating and sacrifice whatever is easiest to sacrifice to make up the deficit because survival is the priority. It's very redundant, I know. But our bodies are still adapted to caveman lifestyles where food was scarce, so it was all about scarfing down as many calories as possible in order to prepare for a potential starving period. Studies have shown that the more weight you lose in a week, the more likely more of the weight loss will be from muscle, bone mass, etc. If you lose 4 pounds in a week, some of it will be from fat, absolutely, but a good deal of it (more than you want) will be from muscle and bone mass as well. 2 pounds is the general guideline to ensure that most of your weight loss is from fat, but even that is pushing it, if you ask me. I can't find the exact study at the moment, but it and many others suggest that the sweet spot is around 1.5 pounds a week to ensure that the weight loss will be primarily from fat. That's still roughly 6-7 pounds a month (which is very good). Keep in mind that no matter what you do, you WILL lose some muscle in your quest to lose fat. It's inevitable. But the loss of muscle tissue can be mitigated with incorporation of heavy weightlifting. Absolutely lift weights or at least do body weight exercises to make it harder for your body to sacrifice muscle. EDIT: I forgot to mention that when you're first starting out on your diet/exercise regimen, it's ok to lose 3-4 or even more pounds of weight a week for the first 2 or 3 weeks. Most of that will be water weight just as /u/tiny10boy said (thank you). __eou__ And to add, if you lose lean tissue, your resting metabolism will be less. That's why people yoyo diet: they go back to what they think is "normal" and because they are burning 10-15% less energy, they immediately gain weight. I'm currently on a weight loss journey (I put it this way because it is going to take some time) and am aiming for 0.5-1.0% loss per week. Sure, it will take a while, but my strength isn't plummeting and I'm still eating 3000 calories a day. __eou__

What is the worst storm you've ever been in? __eou__ 1984, tornado passed directly overhead of me and my father while we were in his truck. We felt it lift slightly off the ground.

When Americans say "would you like cream in your coffee/tea" do they mean milk? __eou__ They mean creamer which is not milk, its another dairy product. __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ You mean rumchata, right? __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ Haha ok. Rumchata is an alcoholic dairy/cream based liquor. It sounds gross but half rumchata and half rum tastes just like cinnamon toast crunch milk. It's a Wisconsin thing. __eou__ [deleted] __eou__

How much do you think Bill Nye got paid to make that ad for laundry detergent, and do you think being in a for-profit ad makes him a "sellout"? __eou__ Sweet Mary, mother of God! The Automoderator didn't take this down! I figure he got paid at least $500K if not $1M, and he's not a sellout as long as he's representing a quality product that doesn't present any conflict of interest issues with him. Whether Persil is such a product I don't know. I use Arm &amp; Hammer with Oxy Clean. RIP Billy Mays. __eou__
How much do you think Bill Nye got paid to make that ad for laundry detergent, and do you think being in a for-profit ad makes him a "sellout"? __eou__ The guy got his start in late-night sketch comedy (Almost Live, in Seattle).

If any show has 'em, you can bet your ass people are gonna be gunned down using 'em. __eou__ not most dangerous but in the wire, there is this place baltimore(not sure of the actual name of place) where crime is rampant, but its just a show cant account to how true though. __eou__ That's called the poor urban neighborhoods at night. I'd say slums but America refuses to admit to itself it has them. They are scary/sad like that in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, New York, Seattle and Boston. __eou__
What is the most dangerous street or place in america portrayed or not in movies, and how real it is compared to the movies or series like the wire? __eou__ I'd guess somewhere in Camden NJ but this article gives a good list.

Then Obama and Hillary should be dead already. __eou__ Yes. Yes, I would kill someone if there was a significant chance I could save millions by doing so. If there was a 1/4 chance that my continuing to live would doom millions, I'd shoot myself in the head right now. Wouldn't you? __eou__ Killing Trump wouldn't save millions, it would probably have the opposite effect. He hasn't started, nor is he interested in, starting any wars. Which is more than can be said about the others who were verbally abusing Russia and starting wars all over the middle-east. __eou__ If you turn out to be right, I will be absolutely delighted to admit I was wrong and celebrate with you.

Men of Reddit who have female best friends, how have you been able to keep your relationship platonic? __eou__ I have women friends. In fact, I get along better with most women than most men.

Tried again the next day. That time went well. Wait, how did I end up married and a father? __eou__ I admire the persistence __eou__ Was more her idea then mine.

We tried dating, but we sucked as a couple. I guess we were very similar, and saw in each other's actions a lot of things we didn't like about ourselves. We decided to kill it before it went anywhere. Stayed as friends, she's still my best and oldest lady friend.

Should state I know for a fact she's not interested in anything with me and I'm not either we're both just good looking enough to serve each others purposes. It's just like idk tying a friends shoe for them? Idk if words can describe how casual this is. It's like I asked if she could help fold my laundry would be in the same boat. I did the dishes or something. __eou__

How can you learn to be more witty in conversations? __eou__ Have more conversations. __eou__
How can you learn to be more witty in conversations? __eou__ On the "humor" side of witty: Practice, and stealing, to an extent. Someone said something funny and witty? Cool, maybe next time if you're in a similar conversation with someone else, you can do your own twist on that thing, and maybe it'll hit or maybe it won't, but most people give a positive response to attempted humor, even if it's not the best joke in the world. It's really a "get out of your own way" thing... don't be afraid of bombing -- sometimes you'll bomb, but if you're not willing to do some "out-there" things, it's very hard to be witty/funny. __eou__

Why do some people change their voice pitch, accent, and personality depending on who they are around? Do they always realize they're doing it? __eou__ I don't always notice but yeah I do it.

Why do some people change their voice pitch, accent, and personality depending on who they are around? Do they always realize they're doing it? __eou__ I wouldn't want to talk to my boss in the same way I talk to my dog. "who's a good boy!" "wanna go outside?" __eou__
Why do some people change their voice pitch, accent, and personality depending on who they are around? Do they always realize they're doing it? __eou__ I do it because I'm dysphoric about the sound of my voice.

How much fuel would he saved by using a KERS system on a prop plane? __eou__ None. Do you understand how either of these ideas work? __eou__ Conceptually I get flywheel hybrids, and there wouldn't be the battery weight. I'm just rusty on math she figures for how often planes need to slow down __eou__
How much fuel would he saved by using a KERS system on a prop plane? __eou__ Not much or at all probably. KERS, as I understand it, is only used for overtakes, something a plane wouldn't need. Then add extra weight from an electric motor and a larger batteries. I'd assume the plane would also need a higher output alternator which would increase the power loss a little. __eou__ I oversimplified: what I mean is a flywheel hybrid. Flywheels are lught, anytime the plane needs to reduce speed, the flywheel would store the energy from the props being slowed down. The flywheel inertia would act as a reverse engine. Then the flywheel could transfer that energy back into the propeller... It's really a question of whether or not aircraft scrub speed enough, which I don't know. __eou__

Girlfriend no longer wants to have sex with you after a 5 year long relationship. What do you do? __eou__ Find out who she's having sex with and move her shit over to his driveway.

What was your first time asking a girl out? __eou__ Middle school, we ended up going to one of the school dances which was cool. __eou__
What was your first time asking a girl out? __eou__ Never __eou__
What was your first time asking a girl out? __eou__ I could give you about half a dozen joke answers since you didn't say serious but the first time I actually asked a girl out was to my high school prom. I asked a girl from another town who I was friends with. I had a huge crush on her and knew that she would never go on a real date with me so I asked her as a friend to go to prom with me. She said yes and I got a pretty picture, which is all I really expected/wanted with her. Before everyone jumps on me for being a reddit-redneckbeard I had randomly hooked up with a couple of girls at parties but I had never asked a girl out. __eou__
What was your first time asking a girl out? __eou__ In second grade I asked a cute redheaded girl out to dinner on Valentine's Day she said yes and we went to friendly's. my parents sat on the other side of the restaurant and we got to eat alone like tiny little grown-ups __eou__
What are the ethical implications of breaking up with a girl/boy for another girl/boy you find more attractive? __eou__ You leave a relationship that you didn't think would work out and try for one that you hope will. The question is whether it's wise to do that or whether you'll always believe the grass is greener and drift from person to person. __eou__
What are the ethical implications of breaking up with a girl/boy for another girl/boy you find more attractive? __eou__ Depends how much you care about the first. And if looks are the only reason you're breaking up. And if the first girl is actually ugly or the second is just hotter. There are few ways to cut it that won't make her and her friends hate you, but *you* know whether you're being a piece of shit or not. __eou__
What are the ethical implications of breaking up with a girl/boy for another girl/boy you find more attractive? __eou__ No whatsoever. __eou__
What are the ethical implications of breaking up with a girl/boy for another girl/boy you find more attractive? __eou__ I think this is closer to a moral standpoint. Even though your morals will guide your ethics, morals are more part of personal beliefs. If people can justify switching partners based on looks then their morals are set in that position currently. So if you think that it's fine. Ethically I would say most western cultures will frown upon this act as it's deemed "shallow" or "superficial". __eou__
What are the ethical implications of breaking up with a girl/boy for another girl/boy you find more attractive? __eou__ None, it happens to everyone and everyone does it to someone else at some point. Now you can't do that when you get married, well you can but it's super shitty because that's a real commitment not to do that shit anymore. So don't get married until you grow out of that phase. __eou__
What was a life-changing rejection you've experienced? (career/university/romantic) and how has it shaped you as a person? __eou__ A German guy got rejected from an art school ran by people of a certain faith... he didn't take it that well. __eou__
What was a life-changing rejection you've experienced? (career/university/romantic) and how has it shaped you as a person? __eou__ At the end of 8th grade I asked out a girl I really liked and was immediately friend put down to friend status. It's a good thing she did this otherwise I would have ended up in the same destructive relationship as my friend did a year later. Also when I was 19 I tried to get a job with American Airlines and didn't realize until they asked for an over the phone interview that I would be forced to move to the Midway Islands. __eou__
What was a life-changing rejection you've experienced? (career/university/romantic) and how has it shaped you as a person? __eou__ Almost got hired at a big-name tech company. They flew me up to Seattle for a day on-site. Finally got to see the hiring manager (not on the agenda- good sign), and I forget everything I ever knew about computers. It pretty much ruined my life. Destroyed my confidence. My wife had assumed I'd get the job, so all her friends and family knew of my failure. It's about three years later, and she has moved back in with her mom, taking our three kids. The really sad thing is, I still have to be a programmer to pay the bills. So every day I get to wake up and do something I suck at, and will never be really good at. All day I stare at reminders of how shitty I am. Man, fuck Seattle and those people. __eou__
What was a life-changing rejection you've experienced? (career/university/romantic) and how has it shaped you as a person? __eou__ I thank God every day that I was rejected from Stanford, which was my top choice for university. I don't think I would have done well there and I know I would hate being in that awful group they try to pass off as a marching band. I'm so happy where I ended up __eou__

What is something people brag about that they shouldn't? __eou__ How much they drink. How much they have sex. How late they stayed up studying. __eou__
What is something people brag about that they shouldn't? __eou__ "Pickup strategies" - some guys are so proud of the ways they come up with to manipulate women into sleeping with them. They think it makes them look cool and manly but really it makes them look like sociopaths. __eou__
What is something people brag about that they shouldn't? __eou__ Being blunt. When people brag about their lack of ability to say something in a tactful way they are usually trashy people. __eou__ Lack of sugar coating makes someone trashy? It depends on the situation. Personally I prefer that people just get to the point and say what they need to say. __eou__ I think this is more of an example of people using the excuse of being blunt as a way to justify that they can say what they want, regardless of whether or not you want to hear it. __eou__ I consider that being an asshole rather than being blunt, but I do agree. __eou__ I do too but, assholes will never look at themselves as the asshole. Can't see much with a brown eye. __eou__

When people brag about their lack of ability to say something in a tactful way they are usually trashy people. __eou__ Lack of sugar coating makes someone trashy? It depends on the situation. Personally I prefer that people just get to the point and say what they need to say. __eou__ Yes, "sugar coating" is one of the phrases common with these people. But try to tell them something about themselves without being extremely tactful and you're going to see some drama. Being tactful is not the opposite of getting to the point. And we're talking about people who brag about it as if disregarding another person's feelings were some kind of special ability. It's not. And people that think it is, in my opinion, are trashy. Should I have said it a nicer way? __eou__
What is something people brag about that they shouldn't? __eou__ How much you hate everyone or how much of a badass you are. How much weed you smoke or alcohol you drink. How many guys or girls you've been with __eou__
What is something people brag about that they shouldn't? __eou__ That they're manipulative. Now I don't trust you at all. __eou__ People who flat out tell you that they're manipulative typically only do so because they want the IMAGE of a smart manipulative person. It actually makes them look like edgy tryhards. __eou__
What is something people brag about that they shouldn't? __eou__ Video game achievements. As an avid gamer I don't give a shit what your rank or K/D is I'm here for fun. __eou__ I've never really got game achievements. They don't do anything, but some people go crazy for them. __eou__
What is something people brag about that they shouldn't? __eou__ Video game achievements. As an avid gamer I don't give a shit what your rank or K/D is I'm here for fun. __eou__ I had a friend who bragged he got all the achievements in a game (Terraria). And started pointing out how I haven't gotten em all yet when i started playing years ahead of him. Idk, he became super competitive and just sucked out the fun of the game __eou__ That's so strange because isn't Terraria a sandbox game? What's the point of going to the beach and seeing who can build a better sandcastle faster when, you go to the beach to relax. __eou__ Exactly, man. __eou__

How do you define a "loser"? __eou__ People who always look for "the easy way" like stealing somebody else work. Not, however, somebody who doesn't do a thing at all. Some people are just content with little, but people who try to obtain things through lazy means are losers. __eou__

What was your worst experience with Reddit? __eou__ I haven't had any really bad ones (yet.) I guess the worst so far was probably the time I talked about my ex ghosting me and some idiot decided I was a stalker because I tried to find out what happened to him. __eou__

What does it mean when a woman advertises herself as a single mom for housecleaning jobs? __eou__ Sympathy points? __eou__
What does it mean when a woman advertises herself as a single mom for housecleaning jobs? __eou__ It mean she wants you to feel sorry for her so you're more likely to hire her than the competition Sympathy manipulation to draw in business __eou__ This right here __eou__
What does it mean when a woman advertises herself as a single mom for housecleaning jobs? __eou__ She's letting you know she's single and doesn't mind being pregnant, if you catch what my dick is dipping in ;) __eou__
What does it mean when a woman advertises herself as a single mom for housecleaning jobs? __eou__ She's a single mom who needs to make money by cleaning houses? __eou__
What does it mean when a woman advertises herself as a single mom for housecleaning jobs? __eou__ Maybe she threw that in to try and illustrate that she is used to hard work, responsibly and cleaning! But hey why not stone the woman to death with your viscious comments. I never realized how much people hate, absolutely hate women until I went on Reddit. Christ. You were not hatched. Didn't you see your own mother struggling? This woman seems to be struggling and trying to do her best and these are the things you say about her? Disgraceful. __eou__ &gt; I never realized how much people hate, absolutely hate women until I went on Reddit. Wut __eou__ Can you even read? __eou__ I figured it out already. You go specific subreddits to search for weirdos who say dumb stuff about women and you're basing that idea off the posts in those subs then you came here and conflated the responses to this stupid question with woman hating because of your bias. __eou__ Not a stupid question. Read the thread. Maybe you can add some wisdom. __eou__

Didn't you see your own mother struggling? This woman seems to be struggling and trying to do her best and these are the things you say about her? Disgraceful. __eou__ hey Romeo, I left out the part about her being a lifer drug addict coke, pills, powder and meth, and hustling everyone around her for money (single mom ad infinitum) so she can make 1am-3am drug runs to see her drug dealer who looks like Eminem complete with the hat and track suit. Currently she is calling churches trying to get a church to pay her 3 months past due rent and utilities (single mom in need) because she has been going out every night to buy drugs for 28 days a week. It really does not matter how much you earn cleaning houses when you show up an hour late every time, expect top dollar, go outside to talk on the phone, text and smoke cigarettes, and then expect to be catered to by a regular client, when are doing that shit (injesting street drugs) more days than not. -At the job site goes into bathroom, shuts door (client's bathroom), 5 minutes later sniffly nose for the duration. &gt;Disgraceful. Still looking for the grace part. __eou__ Exactly. You "left out that part" so whose to know, I certainly wouldn't judge a single mother looking for a job, and that's all the information you provided. I'd suggest to you that instead of deriding this woman you call dcfs and get some help for her children, if she is indeed a drug addict who is leaving them alone in the middle of the night. Maybe worry less about her and more about her innocent and in danger children. __eou__ I did not leave out anything. I asked about the text of an ad. Leaves them alone? Not quite, takes with!! all hours of the night. you think I should rat out and call dcfs. well I am not going to do that. I'd like to put her dealer under the prison, that's for sure, but I just do not know what to do. screwing with people to that level, I do not think it is a good idea on the soul / honesty level. edit: I do not know that the offspring are "in danger" as much as that it is just all effed up. I like the part about not deriding. It is hard to keep a wholesome vibe when someone is doing the deep-druggy dishonesty and working the people around them. __eou__ "Rat out" are you 12? Are you retarded? There are children whose lives are being ruined and in danger. I couldn't live with myself, if I knew this was happening and did nothing about it, but that's just me. Keep being obsessed with this woman for whatever reason instead of helping the people who need help. Her kids. Alright then fuck off. I'm done talking to idiots for the day. __eou__ pardon, I do not share your romance with the resources of the state. maybe you live in a smart progressive area. I don't. government is really dishonest around here. __eou__

Why does the left always think that the right is racist? __eou__ Many ideals that are held by them do not prioritize equality. __eou__
Why does the left always think that the right is racist? __eou__ because it tends most hate crime is cause by the "right". Yes the left has it fair share but it is not on the level the right is. Example is the KKK and Aryan Brotherhood. both have right side ties and are extremely racist __eou__
Why does the left always think that the right is racist? __eou__ They don't, "always". That's a false question. And the word "right" means vastly different things to different people. __eou__
Why does the left always think that the right is racist? __eou__ I think because the left is obsessed with equal racial outcomes. They need all races to be equally represented in all areas of society. The easiest way to do this is to use Affirmative Action and other such programs to affect racial representation. The right is generally opposed to programs that use race as a qualification for a job or position. The left will call them racist for this. __eou__ While true i would say many more on the right than the left believe the majority of Muslims are terrorists and the majority of Mexican immigrants are "criminals and rapists". Which is textbook racism. __eou__ Well, for one thing, Muslim is not a race. It is a member of a religious ideology. Mexican is not a race either. __eou__ Great job doing nothing to address my point __eou__ We should use the right terms, if we are discussing racism. Do you believe that people on the right believe that Latinos are criminals and rapists, and that Middle Eastern people are terrorists? __eou__ Again, you fully understand my point (as long as i may assume you're over the age of 5), so address it or move on __eou__ Nah, I'm good. __eou__ Except at defending your point of view, maybe. __eou__

This can't be true since, as he points out, this isn't racism at all.

If you could have only one day with unlimited money (without any bought carrying over to the next day) what would you do? __eou__ Would buy my mom a house and pay all the bills 30 years in advance, as well as buy her a brand new car (she's never had a new one, only used) Donate enough money to my current college, that if my brother or sister applied to go, they would be accepted no matter bad their grades, as well as start a scholarship for kids who are the first in their families like me to go to college who have no one to turn to for advice. I'd buy my great grandmother a private chauffeur, that way anytime she wants to go out and go somewhere, she doesn't have to depend on us anymore, she can just be independent. (Although knowing her, she would wait until one of us were free to go with her, rendering said chauffeur useless) I'd pay off all my student loans as well as pay all my college expenses up front, plus a home for myself. Also I guess I need a car too so that. __eou__

Foodies/Chefs of Reddit: How Would You Define American Cuisine? [Serious] __eou__ I think it depends which part of America you are in. American cuisine tends to pull from many different cultures/countries like Italian, French etc. __eou__ So, this subreddit doesn't allow clarification past the title, but this raised a question for me. We talk about America pulling from French or Italian cooking, but couldn't the same be said about those countries if you look hard enough? Do you think American Cuisine will develop over time to be used in the same way as French or Italian? __eou__ There may be a time when that might become the norm but for right now I think American cuisine is still trying to find itself. __eou__
Foodies/Chefs of Reddit: How Would You Define American Cuisine? [Serious] __eou__ I'd say there's no such thing as ‘American cuisine.’ What you find in places like Alabama is going to be hugely different from what you find in Maine. Hell, I live in Florida, and if you go from Tallahassee to Miami, it's going to be totally different. Not to mention how a good deal of American cuisine is influenced by immigrants. I guess the best word would be varied. __eou__
Foodies/Chefs of Reddit: How Would You Define American Cuisine? [Serious] __eou__ American cuisine is a melting pot. It's a mixture of brands and styles from across the world (or at least the ones we let in) It's great diversity that could never leave you bored. __eou__

What behavior is completely okay up until you turn a certain age? __eou__ Sucking on your mother's nipples __eou__ What about sucking on someone else's mother's nipples? __eou__ That's fine at any age __eou__ I don't know. It'd be pretty damn weird at like 10. __eou__ Good point lol... I guess it's weird until 18 and it continues to get less weird until around ~30... then it's normal until mid 70s and gradually starts to get weird again __eou__
What behavior is completely okay up until you turn a certain age? __eou__ Sucking on your mother's nipples __eou__ I sucked my mom's chest most days after school up until I was in the 8 or 9th grade.

What behavior is completely okay up until you turn a certain age? __eou__ Using diapers. __eou__
What behavior is completely okay up until you turn a certain age? __eou__ temper tantrum __eou__ Nah, that's not okay at any age. __eou__ Huh? Toddlers are going to have some moments. They're incapable of fully communicating their thoughts. Would that not piss you off at times? __eou__ Doesn't mean you ALLOW it. Starts a temper tantrum? Not going to say that is _completely okay_. Just because things piss you off doesn't mean it's okay to have a temper tantrum - and that needs to be taught from day 1. __eou__ It is completely okay on a developmental level. It's completely ok for a toddler to not understand what the hell is going on. The response of the parent is a different issue. __eou__
What behavior is completely okay up until you turn a certain age? __eou__ Going to the opposite sex's (sexes'???) changing room when going swimming. Usually kids can go on their own in the changing room at 6 years old. __eou__

What kind of relationship do you have with your parents? __eou__ My mother and I are strained, she's an alcoholic with bad choice in men.

I'm definitely a daddy's little girl lol. __eou__
What kind of relationship do you have with your parents? __eou__ My mom and I are best friends. We're both chaotic good partners in crime. We love each other very much. My stepdad is a really nice man. We get along very well, but we're both just quiet people, so we don't talk much. Definitely love him though. My biological dad died about 4 years ago. Good riddance, he was a terrible human being. I don't hate him or anything (and that surprises a lot of people after they learn of the stuff he did to my family and me), but it is what it is. Hearing of his death evoked no emotion whatsoever on my part. I just felt bad for his kids because they lost their dad. __eou__

What kind of relationship do you have with your parents? __eou__ My mom is dead, but at the end of her life, it was friendly but also cool. Kind of like how I'd treat an acquaintance I like. Long history of shitty behavior from her. My dad...I kind of just regard as an overgrown child, because he basically is mentally and physically. He was a hands-off, childish dad for the most part. He has no clue how the world actually works. He just went to work, came home and handled nothing else his entire life. My mom handled everything else. __eou__
What kind of relationship do you have with your parents? __eou__ parent-child relationship. __eou__
What kind of relationship do you have with your parents? __eou__ Love my mother, she's my best friend and I tell her everything (I mean it). Hate talking to my dad, he's into all sorts of conspiracy theories and is generally just a little bit insane. __eou__

What kind of relationship do you have with your parents? __eou__ I'm super close with my mom and my step dad is one of my gaming buddies. I haven't spoken to my biological father since I was maybe 10 (I'm almost 29). He went to jail for vile things and I want nothing to do with him. __eou__
What kind of relationship do you have with your parents? __eou__ My father was an nasty alcoholic and died about ten years ago. My mother is a Narcissist who pushed all the right buttons with alcoholic dad, she delights in making others suffer and tries to pit all of her kids against one another. Three of us see her for what she is, the other three adore her. I only just pass cival conversation with so things are not awkward at family events. I will never forgive her for the things she put us through as kids. To call her a mother is insulting to true caring motherhood. The only good thing I can say about her is that it's made me a better mother as I have become the very opposite of her in every way. I can't understand how you can bring a child into the world just to watch it suffer at your neglect and sick mental tortcher. __eou__

Reddit, what are your best computer pranks for in school or at work? __eou__ I installed CSGO on every student computer in my Secondary School via the networking server.. I had a teacher once show me how to access it as I told him I was interested in studying computing. Once installed via the server it wasn't deletable unless a teacher or IT guy did so but they never knew it was in the system as they never used the student desktops. So everyone got free CSGO. Not much of a prank but it's still there two years later. __eou__
Reddit, what are your best computer pranks for in school or at work? __eou__ Back in the day of Win 98 etc it was definitely the "netsend" commands. __eou__
Reddit, what are your best computer pranks for in school or at work? __eou__ I don't know much about computers, but as a freshman at college computer class, it surprised me how many people knew fuck-all as well. One student asked me if I could help him with a project. We had to make a certain program to solve a problem. I said sure, why not? and tried to tell him what exactly I was doing and how he could replicate it later and then afterwards fixed the project he had on a USB he gave me. A few weeks later he asks the same. I again said, 'why not?' and tried to help him but I noticed he still didn't get some of the simple things I tried to explain to him to do before. I tell him the same things I said before, but this is when I realize he isn't paying attention: he's staring blankly at the screen nodding every once in a while, leading me on but not taking in any information. He was just using me to do his work for him. So this goes on for a couple months. I didn't want to watch him fail on a big project, so I kept helping him out here and there but always trying to encourage him to learn this on his own or at least try to learn how to do it on his own. Besides, we had started talking and hanging out some, so who was I to judge? In high school we shared assignments and helped each other out a lot as a group, so why not help this guy pass a computer class he knows nothing about? Well, eventually I find out that he was talking shit about me behind his back. Basically saying I took too long to explain things; he was hanging out with me solely so I would help him in this class, so after he asks me to do another project of his, I took his USB and corrupted all the files on it. Not with a virus or anything, but just opened up all the stuff in NotePad and deleted some lines and to add effect changed all the names of the documents to very long random letters and numbers - '197sh8u1uhsuh1w98d9sj19' and stuff. Well, he freaks out the next day and thinks he got a virus. He got rid of the USB and completely reset his computer and deleted all his files on his home computer. I tell him next time I saw him that it was a joke and I have a backup of all his stuff, but the damage was already done. __eou__
What words would you change if you could, why, and to what would you rename it? __eou__ The word for rhythm that extends over the bar line is, "Hemiola," as a musician I hate that word because it just makes you sound pretentious in my opinion. If I could, I would just get rid of the definition because to me it's just stupid. __eou__
What words would you change if you could, why, and to what would you rename it? __eou__ Change the words "man/he/him" to "my master". Piss off all those feminists __eou__

My haughtiness and laziness really came through for me, now that I think of it. Had I tried harder in life I might have had some dreadful and stressful job that pays less than mine. I may have been fat with ten kids if I tried harder to please the losers I dated back in the day. __eou__

Assuming Trump serves his full 4 years, how long will it take to recover from the damage he causes? Will it even be possible? __eou__ For the globalists? Nope. Irrecoverable. __eou__
Assuming Trump serves his full 4 years, how long will it take to recover from the damage he causes? Will it even be possible? __eou__ Nah. If America is like Rome where it has the "5 good emperors" and goes downhill from there then Trump is Commodus (although in personality he's more like Nero). We won't fall, but god will we sink. __eou__ How exactly? __eou__ How is he like Nero? Well he does shady real estate things, has a really punchable face, is easily triggered (Nero would make anybody he hated kill themselves), and was one of the thiccest leaders of the time. How is like Commodus? Well, he's shit. __eou__ Oh right, that's cleared that up then :/ __eou__
Assuming Trump serves his full 4 years, how long will it take to recover from the damage he causes? Will it even be possible? __eou__ How long will it take to undo the damage in Libya? __eou__ ...what, what does that have to do with Trump? __eou__ If you're going to be talking about undoing damage, look at the damage Obama has left behind. Trump is no saint but while everyone is crying about what might happen, that he's a racist xenophobic woman hater (based on fuck all) and holding Obama up as some sort of saint, why don't they ever look at things that have actually happened that need clearing up from the previous president? __eou__ I will talk about Obama. I think he was a very good President. I’d give him a solid B. He wasn’t able to and didn’t follow up on all the soaring rhetoric and promises of his historic ’08 campaign, but leaves an important and positive legacy nonetheless. That said, I think we know why people call Trump a xenophobic misogynist. It has to do with, you know, the words that have come out of his own mouth. __eou__ Lol, like what? What has he actually said? Grab them by the slotty? What the fuck do you think a rich 25 year old is going to be doing half the time? What do you think George Washington said about black people when nobody was around? Or indeed more recent presidents such as Clinton? What did he say about women. Come off it! As for racism or xenophobia, I'm yet to hear what he's actually said. Obama has left a lot of shit behind actually, and when he was banning people visiting from certain middle eastern countries, where was the outrage from the same people then? What did these morally superior people do in the whole time the man dropped over 25,000 bombs in the Middle East? They did fuck all, they sat around with their thumbs up their arses moaning about gender fluid bathrooms and the oppression of woman (none existent) __eou__ Yeah, bragging about sexually assaulting women is a big deal, and the fact so many people had no problem with it says some very negative things about our society. If you want to criticize Obama for being the Drone President, that’s fair, but Obama’s 2011 Executive Order concerning Iraqi refugees was not the same as the Trump’s Muslim ban (“ban” being the word he chose.) __eou__ 1. It's not a Muslim ban. Nobody is banned from Indonesia, which has the largest Muslim population in the world. 2. Saying "grab them by the pussy" is evidence of him sexually assaulting women is a logical fallacy. And I think if you did a survey for everyone in the US asking them, is rape bad? Tick yes, or no. How many people would tick yes do you think? __eou__
Assuming Trump serves his full 4 years, how long will it take to recover from the damage he causes? Will it even be possible? __eou__ Getting pretty tired of Trump questions man __eou__
Assuming Trump serves his full 4 years, how long will it take to recover from the damage he causes? Will it even be possible? __eou__ it depends. our stance in international view will take at least 10 plus years. Example: we may fail a bid for internation soccer because of Trump costing US a chance to make money. Enviroment- no way to stop it after him Economy- unknown __eou__
Assuming Trump serves his full 4 years, how long will it take to recover from the damage he causes? Will it even be possible? __eou__ Idk, maybe you should re-dye your hair, make another quirky sign and curse more. __eou__
Assuming Trump serves his full 4 years, how long will it take to recover from the damage he causes? Will it even be possible? __eou__ It depends on how the media and institutions check him, because his own party certainly won’t do that. So far, we’ve seen the courts bat down a sloppily-written Muslim ban, and media pressure has forced the resignation of Flynn and withdrawal of several nominees. He and his supporters certainly seem to want to damage our institutions and basic credibility of government. I think the damage will be semi-permanent, at least a generation or so. It will take that amount of time for some people to swallow their pride, and we really, really need some Boomers to start finally fucking dying. How extensive will the damage be? Predictions are useless, but I’d say moderate, though not severe. A good Category II hurricane. __eou__
Assuming Trump serves his full 4 years, how long will it take to recover from the damage he causes? Will it even be possible? __eou__ 4 years? I think you mean 8. __eou__
Assuming Trump serves his full 4 years, how long will it take to recover from the damage he causes? Will it even be possible? __eou__ If you could recover from Bush's damage then Trump will be a small issue. __eou__
Assuming Trump serves his full 4 years, how long will it take to recover from the damage he causes? Will it even be possible? __eou__ Sounds like someone misses her Obamaphone __eou__

Within a month of those 2 things, I found out I was pregnant with my second child. So, a lot of stress and keeping busy. I've slowly started walking exercises again.

What is socially acceptable that you don't think should be? __eou__ Talking about people in a gross way while they're not around. At first I thought this was just something shitty people did, and that I was just surrounded by shitty people, but *everyone fucking does it*. And I'm around adults... if you've got a problem with someone you should tell them directly and, chances are, they'll stop whatever they're doing. This whole idea of shitting on them while they're not there is the most childish thing I've noticed nearly all adults do. There's not going to be any change to their behavior if you don't even let them know they're doing something annoying or wrong. __eou__

I'll be fine though, I invoked the ancient power before. __eou__ What did you watch? __eou__ Gravity Falls. Greatest cartoon ever IMO. __eou__ What's that like? __eou__ Brilliant. Simply stunning. I had a whole summary written up but my connection broke as I hit "Add Comment," so here's a briefer version: Two twins spend the summer at their great uncle's (Grunkle) tourist trap at the seemingly boring town of Gravity Falls, Oregon. There's a hidden weird side to the town and it's forests, however, and it's filled with monsters, mysteries, and adventures. The plot is brilliant, clever jokes everywhere in it, and plenty of mysteries for you to solve yourself. Visit r/gravityfalls for more if you're interested. __eou__ See I've heard of it and seen small clips on YouTube etc, but may have to give it a longer look into, Cartoon Network? __eou__ It mostly doesn't air anymore. Ended I think February last year. It's on Netflix and Amazon. You can find it on kisscartoon for free if you don't want to pay money. There's two seasons, by the way, I think Netflix only has one. __eou__ I'l have a look see at some point but hoping I can get around to watching it. Cheers for recommending it. __eou__ No problem mate. Have a good one. __eou__

That's a slacker major. __eou__ Sigh. Go ahead and tell us your IQ, how much you make, and all about your degrees, big shot. ~_~ __eou__ I'd go to the link below and sort by Mean Annual Wage. https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000 __eou__

What's the worst date you've ever been on? __eou__ October 11, 2007 __eou__
What's the worst date you've ever been on? __eou__ Went on a date with this one girl. I only talked to her for 5 days. She was 30 years old, didn't have a job, and lived with her parents. I find all of this out when we went on this ONE date. He's the long and short of it. We plan a date at a bar. I meet her there right after I got out of work. I'm wearing a shirt and tie. She's wearing hunting camouflage sweatpants, a pink John Deere hoodie, and no make-up. I couldn't get a word in our conversation without constantly being cut off, she kept joining other people's conversations sitting around us, she hated every song that came on the jukebox because it wasn't country (songs included: Guns and Roses, old Metallica, Twisted Sister, and other old hair bands and some 90s rock) and kept talking about how bad the songs were. We bar hop a little bit and she starts TEXTING me "Are we together?" I'm thinking "Bitch, I barely know you, and from what I know we won't be." Eventually, I decided I've had enough and tell her it's getting late and I should be heading home. She wants to follow me home to make sure I get home safe. Yes, I was drunk. I had to drink myself stupid to tolerate the bitch. I tell her no, but she FUCKING does it anyway. She's like a god damn dog. I get home with her behind me and she fucking follows me inside. She wants to have sex, I don't. I told her it's not a good idea, but before I know it she already had my pants off riding me. Thank God for whiskey dick. After I was RAPED she leaves my house and texts me "I'm glad we're together", "Are you happy?", "ILU." I cut all ties with this chick immediately __eou__ How did you cut ties if she knows where you live? __eou__ I moved __eou__

Depends on the body part and size I'm sure ;) __eou__ Now this is helpful. Thanks. Was just nervous. Had a pretty big one in my leg. Didn't bruise at all. Just had a small piece in my rib. Bruised af __eou__ Whoops responded in the wrong place ;) not much fat to pad the area being tattooed so it makes sense that it would bruise! Hope it doesn't last too long __eou__ Ohhh. Right.

What is your favourite conspiracy theory? __eou__ The Past 30 years of [government/corporate policy](https://www.oxfam.org/en/research/economy-99) were intentionally designed by the ultra wealthy/elite to reintroduce the [divine right of kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings) to the world replacing "because god says so" with "because markets say so" __eou__

Basically made me believe 9/11 was in fact an inside job, in addition to the evidence of thermite/thermate in the dust particles of the debris.

What is your favourite conspiracy theory? __eou__ That the CIA snuffed JFK and used Oswald as a patsy. I actually believe this one __eou__ This is *the* conspiracy theory. It's where the term originated. By the way, the day after Kennedy was Assaasinated, former President Truman who started the CIA, called for the CIA to go back to just intelligence gathering and to cease other activities,. That should give you some insight on what people in know think about it. __eou__ Like they actually followed his orders. I've heard someone say that the CIA is basically a government unto itself. __eou__

What is your favourite conspiracy theory? __eou__ I don't know if this is a "theory". But my favorite event that falls under the conspiracy umbrella is the [Max Headroom Broadcast Hijacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWdgAMYjYSs).

What is your favourite conspiracy theory? __eou__ The one about how Paul McCartney died at the height of Beatles fame and was replaced by another guy so the Beatles could continue being popular. __eou__
What is your favourite conspiracy theory? __eou__ I worked in a bank in a very conservative part of the United States, and customers would often go off on crazy conspiracies while talking to me. My favorite one is that if a U.S. flag has a gold fringe on it, then it is a captain's flag meant to buy flown on a ship. It indicates that the nationality of the ship is American, but the ship is a sovereign property ruled by the captain (or something like that). The flag in the bank branch had a gold fringe, which meant that the bank was essentially an American vessel, and that it didn't have to follow the constitution because it was ruled by the bank CEO. As such, the bank could take whatever money it wanted from its customers and they would have no legal recourse.

What is your favourite conspiracy theory? __eou__ Trump is a wholly owned puppet of Putin. Unfortunately, I'm no longer sure that this qualifies as a conspiracy theory. __eou__ I think you can't count anything out, how do we know that the hole system is not staged. A cabal to control. Just happens trump isn't playing ball so there is huge outcry. No politician has ever delivered. No citation needed. __eou__

Also, what semen doesn't leave behind a crusty stain? I doubt she would wear them without first examining them like most people do __eou__

Morning people, what are some tips you can share about waking up, getting out of bed, and getting on with your day with ease? __eou__ First things first, there is no such thing in getting out of bed with ease. But it does help if you make your alarm one of your favorite songs rather than that horrible beep. __eou__
Morning people, what are some tips you can share about waking up, getting out of bed, and getting on with your day with ease? __eou__ Get 8+ hours of sleep. Honestly, I think it's largely genetic. When I wake up, I go from sleep to total alertness/readiness to go in seconds. Hubby takes literally hours. __eou__ Yeah I think it's genetic. I don't have any tricks, it just happens. __eou__

When I wake up, I go from sleep to total alertness/readiness to go in seconds. Hubby takes literally hours. __eou__ Genetic? Possibly, I wouldn't rule it out. But I think you can train yourself too.

Morning people, what are some tips you can share about waking up, getting out of bed, and getting on with your day with ease? __eou__ Go to bed and get up at the same time every, single day. Even on weekends/days off when you want so badly to sleep in. Give yourself enough time to get enough sleep, and stick to the schedule. Your body should learn to go to sleep fast at your appointed bedtime, and wake up around the same time every day without much effort. I usually wake up a minute or two before my alarm now, and I'm fairly alert upon waking. Unless something out of the ordinary is going on, my sleep schedule is pretty predictable. Pretend the snooze button doesn't exist. It is not your friend here. Disclaimer: I don't suffer from any chronic sleep disorders, and I only know what worked for me. __eou__
Morning people, what are some tips you can share about waking up, getting out of bed, and getting on with your day with ease? __eou__ I'd say go to sleep and wake up the same time everyday. It's like conditioning your body to be sleepy at a certain time and to be awake after a certain number of hours. Aside from that, when you wake up, learn to get out of bed as soon as you can. I noticed that the longer it takes for me to get out of the bed, the lazier i become __eou__
Morning people, what are some tips you can share about waking up, getting out of bed, and getting on with your day with ease? __eou__ I try to prepare for my morning as much as possible the night before. This was a hard habit to get into but it's really made my days so much better. Before I go to bed, I try to lay out my clothes, pack my gym bag, pack my lunch, and set up my coffee for the morning. That way when I get up, most of the hard work is done and I can spend a bit more time enjoying coffee and don't feel as rushed. I also try to turn off screens about an hour before bed (I often fail at this) but I get into bed at a decent hour and try to wind down naturally. __eou__

Morning people, what are some tips you can share about waking up, getting out of bed, and getting on with your day with ease? __eou__ Condition yourself into it. I always wake up extremely hungry, so my sleepy self just drags me to the kitchen where coffee and oats are already waiting. It took some weeks of leaving an apple at the bedroom door and going to bed early and having really light stuff for dinner. Also, you can try waking up 10-15 minutes earlier than you need, to have some "me time"where you can relax/play a game/read/eat candies/whatever takes stress out of the routine before start rushing. Treat yourself every morning until you crave that time alone. __eou__
What is a random realization that completely blew your mind? __eou__ That six ate nine, as opposed to six eight nine. That was always a dumb joke that always made everyone fake laugh and groan, but I didn't understand until my junior year of high school when it clicked __eou__ Who taught you to count? __eou__ I think my kindergarten teacher? All I remember from kindergarten is rubbing my teachers feet so maybe that's where my problem is. __eou__
What is a random realization that completely blew your mind? __eou__ How crazy it is that we all have the ability to be aware of our own thoughts and feelings. I wonder if animals ever think, why do I do the things I do? __eou__ [deleted] __eou__
What is a random realization that completely blew your mind? __eou__ Some people actually think you can be fat and healthy. Some people are just THAT stupid. __eou__ Well the term fat is subjective. If you base it off of weight alone, professional athletes are considered obese, even though with the amount of work they do with their bodies, they're considered exceptionally healthy. But I take it you mean people who are like 200+ pounds who aren't athletes. __eou__ Or you could go by BMI which would be more accurate. To be fair I think some overweight people can be healthy, but obese and upwards? Nope. __eou__

But I take it you mean people who are like 200+ pounds who aren't athletes. __eou__ I don't think anyone would consider an athlete who has so much muscle that their BMI goes over 25 to be "fat". Muscular would be the more appropriate word. When we say someone is "fat", it is the 200+ pound obese person who cannot wipe their own arse. __eou__ I agree with you there. However I do know some people who others would consider obese, who do eat healthy and work out, except they just don't seem to loose weight easily. But I mean if the only exercise you get is walking from your car parked in the handicap spot, to the motorized cart in Walmart, I believe that's not healthy __eou__ &gt; except they just don't seem to loose weight easily Then they are eating more calories than they need. Also, you can eat healthy and work out and still be unhealthy, because having excess fat on your body is in itself unhealthy. Extra pressure is put on organs, your body needs to work harder to do anything, etc. "Fat and fit" is an oxymoron. __eou__

People who have used "I had to poop" as an excuse for something, how did it work out? __eou__ I use it at least twice a day at work just to get a free 15 minute break. It always works out great, until someone goes into the restroom and knocks on the door because they seriously have to shit. Then I feel tremendous guilt for fake pooping and causing someone else to have to hold their shit in. __eou__ Good idea, but is there only one stall? __eou__
People who have used "I had to poop" as an excuse for something, how did it work out? __eou__ I'm telling you, all it takes is shitting your pants during a team meeting one time and you can use that excuse all you want.

What's something that people believe strongly in, but you have PROOF it doesn't exist? __eou__ Technically there is no such thing. Because you can't prove a nonexistence. __eou__ Not quite, though that is a good principle. People believe in a flat Earth, but there is overwhelming proof that the Earth is round. Upvote for you because this principle is normally spot on, but there are numerous exceptions. __eou__ I guess that works. It just was going through my mind that he wanted a specific "thing" and the Earth being flat is a concept? __eou__

[Serious] What are the odds of guessing on every question of a 20 question test (multiple choice: A, B, C, or D), and getting a 100%? __eou__ I did this on a test for a summer reading book. Got 50 questions right, guessed like 85% of them. But got a 50% overall Bc I failed all the written questions. __eou__ Yeah, well. That's usually how it always ends when I guess. I asked in hopes that one of these days I'll land a decent grade guessing. A 0.000009% chance though? Doesn't look promising. __eou__ Can usually narrow it down to a couple possible answers.

What do you guys think about a 12 year old white Texan boy who exclusively likes black girls (it's been that way for four years)? __eou__ He came home one day around four years ago telling me he kissed a black girl, and said once you go black, you can't go back. He's hit puberty recently and now he's only gotten more into just black girls, I'd be fine if he preferred black girls, but this seems like he's developed a fetish. Edit: No, he doesn't listen to hip hop, he likes people like Frank Sinatra and Nat King Coke. Just mentioned that, because I've been asked that. __eou__ Kid is going places in life. He's only 12 years old and he already likes the thicc bitches. __eou__

Edit: No, he doesn't listen to hip hop, he likes people like Frank Sinatra and Nat King Coke. Just mentioned that, because I've been asked that. __eou__ That doesn't sound like a fetish. It sounds like a pre-teen boy being weird. Either he's just attracted to black girls, or he realizes it makes you uncomfortable, so he's hamming it up. It might not hurt to have a conversation about respecting women, if that's your concern, which he's probably due for anyway, whoever he's attracted to. __eou__ I'm his older brother, dated a black girl last year, and I haven't let him know I think it's strange, so I don't think he knows. My dad hates when I try to talk to him about things, and just tells me to leave him alone, but I might try talking to him about it. __eou__ I assumed you were a parent from the context, but fair enough. Honestly, sometimes conversations like that are better coming from older siblings. But I wouldn't start with "I think this is strange," because you'll just put him on the defensive and make him feel ashamed. It really doesn't sound that concerning to me though. It sounds like he hasn't learned how to moderate his sexuality yet, but you're obviously much closer to the situation than I am. __eou__ I guess so, I might wait a few more years and see how things go, but I might tell him about objectifying women though just as a heads up for the future. Thanks for the advice, mate, I appreciate it! :) __eou__
What do you guys think about a 12 year old white Texan boy who exclusively likes black girls (it's been that way for four years)? __eou__ A fetish?? lol he's fine. Why is this a problem? He wants some chocolate!! People like what they like. __eou__ I don't want him to objectify them, that's the main concern. __eou__ You are objectifying them. __eou__ How so? __eou__ Would you be freaking out if he was into white girls? Why is it even worth mentioning? __eou__ Actually, yes. I have a white friend exclusively into white girls, and I tell him all races are beautiful, but he says he hasn't seen any attractive women besides white women. __eou__
What do you guys think about a 12 year old white Texan boy who exclusively likes black girls (it's been that way for four years)? __eou__ Preference is one thing. Fetishistic behavior is another thing. So long as its respectful, I guess I don't see a problem with it. __eou__ He hasn't done anything wrong, but I'm afraid of him objectifying them with fetishistic behavior. Do you think it'll be alright? __eou__ Thats a tossup man, all depends on the values he was instilled with, and if he can retain and apply them. __eou__
What do you guys think about a 12 year old white Texan boy who exclusively likes black girls (it's been that way for four years)? __eou__ Whatever. You do you. Black chicks are hot. I'd love to get me some brown sugar. All women are beautiful, racially speaking that is. __eou__ Black chicks are hot and all girls are beautiful racially speaking, I agree, but I'm afraid he might objectify black women with fetishistic behavior, do you think it's alright? __eou__ He's 12. I think you're looking into this too much. Give it a few more years. __eou__ Maybe so, he might realize in a few years if it's fetish like or he is just really attracted to black girls. __eou__

What do you guys think about a 12 year old white Texan boy who exclusively likes black girls (it's been that way for four years)? __eou__ He's in for a rude awakening. __eou__ What do you mean? __eou__ I guess you aren't really aware of the real world. You'll figure things out. Safe to say we are NOT all the same. The world is NOT a kumbaya place. __eou__ What will his rude awakening be? What do I need to figure out? __eou__ Nevermind. I realize you are either young, not very wise, stupid, or baiting me. Not worth my time. __eou__ I'm 18, I'm just confused on what you mean, you're being very cryptic so it's confusing, and I'm not even sure if you understand what the rude awakening really is, and just kind of said it. __eou__ Black culture is very violent and anti social. Not everywhere, not all blacks, but most everywhere. He might get lucky and avoid that problem. __eou__ Thank you for explaining how you feel about that, I appreciate the explanation. __eou__

What is something that happened to you that at the time was very serious, but now is very funny? __eou__ I had a motorcycle accident and broke my left arm and severely sprained my right. At the incident it definitely wasn't funny but after seeing that both my arms were injured I never got the end of the 'broken arms' jokes. __eou__

What is something that happened to you that at the time was very serious, but now is very funny? __eou__ When there was an accidental discharge of Husbands AR-15 a few years ago. Nobody was hurt, but there's a hole through the fridge and house now. He panicked to the point of passing out at the time, but when we calmed down the next day and looked at the damage, it was hilarious to see how much frozen pizza and ice cream was wrecked by the bullet. We never found it either. __eou__

If you can save your own mom would you save her life or make her better and how? __eou__ yeah she needs more fat in her diet or she's gonna be frazzled __eou__
If you can save your own mom would you save her life or make her better and how? __eou__ Dear Reddit, first I really like your website and I think the xbox one is the best place I like to read it because it is intresting and stuff. So if you have a mom and she would get sick alot, would you save her? And how? Because my mom gets sick alot because she has teeth that hurt her and make her sick and then I heard her tell my dad in there room that the docter told her if she keeps getting sick and taking medecine that it will not work anymore it can stop working and she could even get very sick and I don’t want her to die. I told my sister that and we had a idea because we are not old to get a job I am in grade 4. And she is grade 3. Well our idea was you can go to all the houses in our city and ask people for just 1 penny only and then if you save all the pennies then you have enough to save your mom. But we went to some houses on our street today and not many were home but we got 19 pennies and a actual doller and so we looked on the internet how much pennies we need and it is so many. Even maybe a million. And we don’t have that many people around us so we need new ideas. So thank you and bye. __eou__ I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt here. My Mom was very sick and died a few years ago. My brother was the same age as you. Unfortunately, you probably can't save her. Everyone will die someday, and your mom already knows this. Spend as much time with her as you can. Make her life as easy as possible. Clean up around the house and bring her things she needs, with no complaints. Its sad when someone you love dies, but it's even harder for your Mom to imagine dying and leaving you behind. Do your best to make her not worry about this. Be strong for her while she's sick, and prove to her that she has taught you how to be a good person. I'm sure she appreciates the pennies, but it will mean much more to her if you spend your spare time just being a kid and having fun, or helping her out, or spending time with her. __eou__ I also want to add...I'm not saying your mom is going to die anytime soon! Most of the time, sick people get better and will not die. Try not to worry about it too much, and just help her as much as you can. If she doesn't die for another 100 years, she will always remember how much you helped her when she was sick __eou__

I work outside as a stockman at walmart and they always smell putrid from some of the people who use them. I either carry them or just put my knee on the seat now just because of how bad they are. Working at walmart has made me into a germaphobe __eou__ I'm sure their farts probably literally drill into the seats. There is just no where else the gas has a chance of escaping from. __eou__

What do you wish wasn't so socially accpetable? __eou__ pda. It's so gross and I think it's rude. __eou__ PDA is kinda broad... holding hands can is considered PDA.

What do you wish wasn't so socially accpetable? __eou__ Obesity... Some people need some pressure to lose it or they wait until it truely affects their health. __eou__ I don't know. Normalizing obesity and acting like it isn't a health concern is an issue, but attacking people openly over this stuff isn't going to solve anything. Its been proven to make the problem worse for most. __eou__ I agree people shouldn't be bullied about being over weight. But when someone complains about their knee pain, back pain etc. it shouldn't be rude for me to say "your ____ hurts because you're overweight." __eou__
What do you wish wasn't so socially accpetable? __eou__ Obesity... Some people need some pressure to lose it or they wait until it truely affects their health. __eou__ I was obese because I was depressed. People mocking me for it didn't help even a tiny bit. __eou__

What do you wish wasn't so socially accpetable? __eou__ Being religious. Ancient superstitions are given far too much respect. __eou__ Overtly religious? (Door knocking) or privately religious?

What do you wish wasn't so socially accpetable? __eou__ Being dismissive of suicidal thoughts. Calling suicide "selfish." __eou__ Why __eou__ What has always bothered me about people calling suicide"selfish" is how they throw around "don't you know it will impact *others*? How it will make *them* feel?" While this person is alone and hurting __eou__ I had a relative kill herself while her two children were at school. If a neighbor hadn't just happened to come by in the afternoon, her two children would have found their mother dead. I don't believe that suicide is always selfish, but let's not pretend it never is. __eou__ To me, if someone with children, especially small children, kills themselves, it is not a measure of how selfish they are, but rather the unimaginable enormity of their pain. What would it take to leave behind your children?? Something literally unbearable. __eou__ She did it where her children would find her! __eou__ She may have been an exception. That is, she may have had some severe personality disorder that made her either sadistic, or unable to feel compassion, and sickly *wanted* her children to find her. That's statistically unlikely, but possible. She may have been a drug addict who, due to the drugs, had lost her motherly instincts. That's possible. Otherwise, I believe she was so far gone in agony and hopelessness that was so extreme that she was unable to do it in a way that her children would not find her. This can appear to be selfish. *Anyone* killing themselves can appear to be selfish, even if they make sure their children don't find them, even if they don't have children at all. I'm not minimizing the extraordinary anger and hurt that this leaves behind for family members. It's horrifying and has a lifetime effect on those left behind. I'm only saying that (usually) it is a greatly misunderstood act. I'm really talking about the abstract misunderstanding of suicide as a selfish act, not the justifiable anger that loved ones are going to feel. Many people say they "would never do that no matter what never ever ever," they'd never do that to their families; they could never be that "selfish." Well.....there are states of existence that can push one further than they can possibly imagine, and lead them to need to leave this earth. __eou__
What do you wish wasn't so socially accpetable? __eou__ Being dismissive of suicidal thoughts. Calling suicide "selfish." __eou__ Why __eou__ What has always bothered me about people calling suicide"selfish" is how they throw around "don't you know it will impact *others*? How it will make *them* feel?" While this person is alone and hurting __eou__ I had a relative kill herself while her two children were at school. If a neighbor hadn't just happened to come by in the afternoon, her two children would have found their mother dead. I don't believe that suicide is always selfish, but let's not pretend it never is. __eou__ To me, if someone with children, especially small children, kills themselves, it is not a measure of how selfish they are, but rather the unimaginable enormity of their pain. What would it take to leave behind your children?? Something literally unbearable. __eou__ She did it where her children would find her! __eou__ /u/mordeci00, I did not mean to sound uncaring about the horribleness of what happened in your family. I am afraid my words have sounded that way, and I'd like to try to correct that. Suicide, especially the one that you describe, leaves behind terrible pain, anger and often guilt. For your relative's children, it's an unimaginable tragedy. I never meant to deny that. __eou__

What do you wish wasn't so socially accpetable? __eou__ In the US (or at least in Maine), drinking and driving is *way* too socially acceptable. __eou__ Yeah definitely. When I was at vocational school, technically we weren't supposed to drink because a party got out of hand once long before we got there and the owner of the school got in trouble. Anyway, people would drink 3 or 4 drinks and then run out and drive to the store. I don't care what your tolerance is, that shit is unsafe. It was never even the bigger guys, it was usually the skinny women that would do this, so it was even worse, drunkenness wise. __eou__
What do you wish wasn't so socially accpetable? __eou__ In the US (or at least in Maine), drinking and driving is *way* too socially acceptable. __eou__ I'm in Australia, but in certain circles of people I've encountered, drunk driving, texting and driving, and purposely reckless driving in general is also way too acceptable, in fact it's almost like sport and entertainment. They'll laugh and joke about it like there are no consequences, and if you question it, you're uptight and no fun. __eou__

What do you wish wasn't so socially accpetable? __eou__ The sense of "Entitlement." I get so sick of people thinking they own their personal space.

What do you wish wasn't so socially accpetable? __eou__ Apparently it is OK to complain about men, like in news editorials, while describing them as 'bald'. It's minor, but strikes me as really weird in these super-PC days. It is like veiled sexism meets ageism. It is the SJW type articles that do this too. I'm not bald myself. __eou__ Hairist! __eou__

It's minor, but strikes me as really weird in these super-PC days. It is like veiled sexism meets ageism. It is the SJW type articles that do this too. I'm not bald myself. __eou__ Do you have an example? I really don't know what you mean. Is it not ok to describe a man as bald? It's a neutral characteristic. __eou__ "I was in a shop the other week and an old, bald man said something racist..." Maybe *I'm* being PC, but whether he is bald is irrelevant. Obviously an article about men's grooming might mention that a man is bald, that might be relevant. An article giving a physical description of someone being sought by police could also describe the suspect. __eou__ Ah, I see what you mean. I'm not sure I usually see it used so derogatorily, but maybe if you had a link I'd recognize what you're saying a bit more. I don't know that you're being PC but it might be something you're a little sensitive about rather than a majorly endemic rash of discrimination against bald men. __eou__ I've noticed it only a few times, just this year really. It just stands out because even news editorials don't often include irrelevant physical descriptions. I'm not actually bald but some might say 'old'. __eou__ Hm. I guess if it isn't pervasive and you can't come up with an example, I'm not sure I'd call it "so socially acceptable." But I suppose I'll keep an eye out for that sort of thing. __eou__

What do you wish wasn't so socially accpetable? __eou__ Employers having extremely strict dress codes with regards to tattoos, piercings, hair colour, nail colour, etc. Unless it's truly a safety issue (like vulnerable piercings in a factory or some such) it's just antiquated and pointless. __eou__ Where do you work that they are so strict about this? I work for a financial investment firm and I have a full beard and multiple tattoos. I think in some industries the old school behavior is dying out along with the old school employees. __eou__ Cancer center. We have a whole nonsense dress code about no visible tattoos, natural hair colours, nails have to be the same conservative paint colour. I don't even see patients! Even if I did, still obnoxious. __eou__
What do you wish wasn't so socially accpetable? __eou__ Asking "how are you?" And variations to relative strangers. I loathe being asked this. __eou__
What do you wish wasn't so socially accpetable? __eou__ Hitting your children. As someone who has around 6 nieces/nephews all under the age of 6, I 100% totally understand the feeling of *wanting* to hit a child for being an asshole or whatever. **But they don't know that** (for the most part). But somehow it's acceptable to openly talk about beating your kids and "teaching them a lesson." WTF? Also, when people respond with "Oh, I was hit as a child and I turned out fine" - no, you didn't. You grew up to be an adult that thinks that striking a child is an acceptable form of parenting. __eou__

Then I remember the feeling and all odd thoughts blew out the window. __eou__ Oh it's amazing. It's weird when you think about it, but it's also amazing.

What gets increasingly weird the more you think about it? __eou__ War. Or killing another person in general. Maybe it made more sense back in the day when it was kill or be killed, but modern war seems so absurd. You are so mad at one group of people, probably based on some abstract philosophy or religion that you barely understand, that you are willing to invent and carry a lot of machinery, organize huge groups, and then going up to the people you don't like and breaking all their meaty parts until they stop operating as a living organism. And a majority of the people that do this would probably never actually do this on their own without being organized in groups and yelled at by one human in particular. And we invent all different kinds of ways to break apart their meaty parts. We have invented a device, that uses an explosive to fire pieces of metal through a tube so fast, that when they hit the meaty part of someone you don't like, it blasts a hole where all the liquids drain out, or at least enough of the liquid to disable the entire organism. Sometimes that's not enough, and we have to create a huge explosive so the shockwave and shrapnel actually blows a lot of meaty parts all over the place. Sometimes, we just prefer to set fire to people we don't like. George Carlin had a bit about flamethrowers that explains this concept. "I'd really like to set those people on fire, but they are so far away. If only there was some way to THROW the flame on them..." The entire thing seems to be just finding creative ways to disassemble a human being without worrying about having to put them back together again. Putting a human being back together again takes skill, but pulling them apart requires very little skill. It seems rather lazy to me. And when you think about it, the first practical use of atomic power was to burn tens of thousands of people we never met. It was almost like the most crude way to use atomic power ever. "Well, we found a way to harness atomic power. However, it's extremely dangerous. In an unchecked chain reaction, it could cause a catastrophic explosion. Now, we could figure out a way to generate electricity this way… Or… We could just save a lot of time and use the explosion for some other purpose. Hey. We really don't like those Japanese people all the way over there in Japan. Not that I met one. But I'm told the Japanese are inhuman and crafty. And I always have been kind of curious what a big explosion would do. Ah? AH? Let's call the government." __eou__

British people of Reddit, how is the American Revolution taught in Britain? __eou__ It tends not to get taught when History is compulsory (i.e before age 14 when people decide their GCSEs) One possible GCSE history course does focus on it however. Compulsory History lessons in my experience tend to focus on specific periods, places (for example units on say the tudors, victorians, the world wars or the transatlantic slave trade) instead of giving a broad scale picture of history. The only time I personally remember touching upon the American revolution in school was to give some context as to the politics of revolutionary France.

What are some ways the real world is better than or equivalent to college (please)? __eou__ College is in the real world, it's not made up. __eou__
What are some ways the real world is better than or equivalent to college (please)? __eou__ Better than? LOL, that’s tough, man. College is like a four-year reprieve from the real world where you get to learn neat things and be around thousands and thousands of attractive people at their physical prime and of your preferred sex. How is the real world better than college? Well, you’re hopefully not asking mom and dad for money now. You might get really, really, REALLY lucky and find a job you actually find meaningful and fulfilling. Hopefully, you’ll find things like sports and video games a lot less important. But then again, you’ll increasingly realize that politics isn’t a game or some debating society, that it matters, and that’s a lot less fun. __eou__ Just a guy trying to come to terms with graduating! __eou__

Hey Reddit, what's your craziest "I have a stalker" story? __eou__ Let's just say I almost made it to the MTV show "Catfish" someone had been impersonating me on Facebook and other platforms from 2009-2015 (when I found out) __eou__
Hey Reddit, what's your craziest "I have a stalker" story? __eou__ Back in the nineties a girl went thru the phone book page by page looking for my address so she could get my phone number. Then called 8-10 times a day for weeks trying to get ahold of me. __eou__ That must have been really good for your self-esteem. You must have been quite flattered. __eou__ Sure it's a ego boost but remember boys and girls never stick your dick in crazy. Especially if crazy knows where you live. __eou__ Unfortunately, I learned that lesson the hard way. __eou__
Hey Reddit, what's your craziest "I have a stalker" story? __eou__ You wouldn't believe me. __eou__
What's your motivation for life? __eou__ Outlive my cat, and spectate the progress of humanity. __eou__ I don't think I want to outlive my cat, that would be sad __eou__ More of a depression thing. Without him, I'd just be watching the fuck up that humanity is without my little scruffball. I'm tell everyone he will make it to 30. :) __eou__
What's your motivation for life? __eou__ Hard question to answer right now. __eou__
What's your motivation for life? __eou__ Imagine what can be instead of what isn't __eou__

What's your motivation for life? __eou__ These days...I've got less than zero motivation __eou__

What's your motivation for life? __eou__ The possibility that somehow I end up as a post-apocalypse protagonist. Plot armor hasn't failed me yet. __eou__
What's your motivation for life? __eou__ I like to imagine that I'm someone who was just created and woke up in my body. It's amazing all the opportunities and beauty that are available to me. I just need to take them. I like All This Beauty from The Weepies, especially the line: "And what you make of it, let me say / you get what you take from it so be amazed / at every stop, at every stop, at every stop / you gotta be brave". There are beautiful, breathtaking things that you experience every day. You just have to notice it, and put the work in to being grateful for yourself and for the world. __eou__
What's your motivation for life? __eou__ All of my ancestors died to put me here, with all these opportunities. I will be damned if I am not doing everything I can to earn it! __eou__

Why do all the uninteresting and boring or maybe a little douchey people get to go out with people that have nothing in common with them, but a nice, caring, witty, humorous, etc. person is turned down or ignored? __eou__ Small penis, whiny, emotionally a bitch __eou__ Big penises can also be whiny emotional bitches. __eou__ That is true. __eou__
Why do all the uninteresting and boring or maybe a little douchey people get to go out with people that have nothing in common with them, but a nice, caring, witty, humorous, etc. person is turned down or ignored? __eou__ Wow. Tell us how you really feel? __eou__ I totally opened a door for a girl at school and she didn't blow me, I hate women! __eou__
Why do all the uninteresting and boring or maybe a little douchey people get to go out with people that have nothing in common with them, but a nice, caring, witty, humorous, etc. person is turned down or ignored? __eou__ Wow. Tell us how you really feel? __eou__ Me? __eou__
Why do all the uninteresting and boring or maybe a little douchey people get to go out with people that have nothing in common with them, but a nice, caring, witty, humorous, etc. person is turned down or ignored? __eou__ I'm mean to everyone and I'm a pretty negative person. People invite me to stuff all the time. Just be a savage and you'll be fine... __eou__ Nah fuck that man, I don't mean to be a little bitch, but be yourself. __eou__ I'm hapily negative. it makes me happy to criticize people. __eou__ Well, that's good. Be happy. __eou__
Why do all the uninteresting and boring or maybe a little douchey people get to go out with people that have nothing in common with them, but a nice, caring, witty, humorous, etc. person is turned down or ignored? __eou__ I suspect that the nice, caring, witty, humorous people are not really as you describe. I suspect that you don't have a full grasp of who the person is. __eou__ *cough* *cough* That's me I'm talking about... *cough* *cough* I was trying to vent... *cough* *cough* __eou__
Why do all the uninteresting and boring or maybe a little douchey people get to go out with people that have nothing in common with them, but a nice, caring, witty, humorous, etc. person is turned down or ignored? __eou__ Lacking in jolly cooperation __eou__ Haha. Glad I have some Dark Souls fans here. __eou__
Why do all the uninteresting and boring or maybe a little douchey people get to go out with people that have nothing in common with them, but a nice, caring, witty, humorous, etc. person is turned down or ignored? __eou__ coz you spell boi the gay way. __eou__ Well exxxcccuuuuuuusssseee me, princess! __eou__ And that...... just then..... :) __eou__ What are you saying? __eou__ Oh, that I'm gay. I'm a fucking tard some times. __eou__ So am I, just realized you said people, not women, and you use boi. Either way, nice and caring usually means boring. You need to try to be a little bit more evil. Try using the words 'fuck off' at least once a day. __eou__ Dude, I swear like a motherfucking sailor. That's also probably a big factor in this. __eou__
Why do all the uninteresting and boring or maybe a little douchey people get to go out with people that have nothing in common with them, but a nice, caring, witty, humorous, etc. person is turned down or ignored? __eou__ Women have an aversion to Nice Guys. Lose the "woe is me, please blow me" attitude, and maybe your luck will change. __eou__ Uh, that's not my attitude in the first place. And I'm not even a nice guy in the normal sense, I'm just not a shithead like everyone else. Also, the 'please blow me' is a little too far dude. I'm not horny. __eou__ lol __eou__
Why do all the uninteresting and boring or maybe a little douchey people get to go out with people that have nothing in common with them, but a nice, caring, witty, humorous, etc. person is turned down or ignored? __eou__ That's an oddly specific question. A: I don't know. __eou__
Why do all the uninteresting and boring or maybe a little douchey people get to go out with people that have nothing in common with them, but a nice, caring, witty, humorous, etc. person is turned down or ignored? __eou__ Because the ones that go out with douches are not going out with them for their amazing personality __eou__ Then why are they? Also, cool username. __eou__ Status, money, sex, who knows. It's different for every person. I'm not a relationship expert __eou__ Status makes a ton of sense. __eou__
Why do all the uninteresting and boring or maybe a little douchey people get to go out with people that have nothing in common with them, but a nice, caring, witty, humorous, etc. person is turned down or ignored? __eou__ I find that most guys who complain about this shit sure aren't willing to give a chance to any number of girls because of reasons that are just as superficial. __eou__ But I do try, and never works out. __eou__
Why do all the uninteresting and boring or maybe a little douchey people get to go out with people that have nothing in common with them, but a nice, caring, witty, humorous, etc. person is turned down or ignored? __eou__ Confidence, money, looks, charms. __eou__ I know, I know. You guys are trying to point out I'm a loser. __eou__
Why do all the uninteresting and boring or maybe a little douchey people get to go out with people that have nothing in common with them, but a nice, caring, witty, humorous, etc. person is turned down or ignored? __eou__ because they don't trust you. no one is totally nice... the assumption is that un-niceness already exists, so a lack there-of is interpreted as dishonesty. my grandmother was very crude, but it always felt nice when she said I was handsome because she doesn't bullshit. thanks g-ma. __eou__ That's sweet. And a very interesting way of thinking of it. __eou__

What's your biggest secret? __eou__ 99% of kids and babies disgust and horrify me. I hate kids and don't ever want any. However, my husband does. I've told him that I'm open to at least one, which I am (albeit reluctantly as fuck), but I'm hoping that it doesn't happen. He's had a hernia as a kid, so he's only got one working nut, so that may affect our chances. I have an IUD birth control implant, which he and his mother didn't want me to get, due to the risk of fertility loss. That's a big part of why I got it, and I'm secretly hoping that that'll happen. This admission should be proof enough of how much of a piece of shit I am, and I shouldn't have kids. __eou__ Do you have issues in your marriage because of this? __eou__ Sometimes __eou__

What's your biggest secret? __eou__ I would like my boyfriend to ask his friends (they all work out a lot) to gangfuck me. I wouldn't tell him that I like them physically, but he knows I wouldn't like to get fucked by average guys. This is because my boyfriend is getting pretty huge himself, so now I'm addicted to the body building look. I'm also trying to get super fit myself. If I had the opportunity I'd get a group of fit girls for him to fuck. We both know it'll happen eventually, but I specifically want one of his friends, who is pretty fit and muscular. __eou__

Reddit, how was your day? __eou__ Kind of shit actually. Our dishwasher hasn't been working properly for a month, and it's been about as long since we've notified the property management people we rent from. There has been no progress made with the issue, and it's irritating me to no end that I've had to actually drive out to their office to speak with someone. When I got home, I tried several times to figure out how to make something work with my video making and editing, but after five attempts, I had to put it away. And now, we have no water or water pressure at all in the house. The sinks and shower are barely a drip, but thankfully the toilet still flushes. I guess it wasn't a total bust though, I just cooked for my husband, and we had a nice nap. __eou__ Aw, that's bad to hear. But hey! I cant get a nap for the life of me. Here have [This](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1oCLY78kZdDcEhfemlVendXZnM). __eou__ Well, the water is working again, so that's good. And that link made my day a lot better, thank you __eou__

Hence why I was still listening to her while she already had someone new. __eou__ Are you still talking to her? __eou__ When I found out she had someone new? Nope. Told her she was an awful person in a call after I found out, but then respected her decision and stopped talking. Just been a day since then. __eou__ Good. She was stringing you on. She wants to make you jealous because she likes the attention. She's an awful person. __eou__

[Serious] When your ex girlfriend immediately gets into a new relationship after breakup but does her best to hide it from you, mentions how she still wants to marry you and calls you every now and then asking if you miss her, what are your ex's intentions for doing so? __eou__ She wants to make you her side hoe. __eou__ Ouch.

[Serious] When your ex girlfriend immediately gets into a new relationship after breakup but does her best to hide it from you, mentions how she still wants to marry you and calls you every now and then asking if you miss her, what are your ex's intentions for doing so? __eou__ Do not answer her calls or texts, she has no intentions of marrying or ever getting back with you. I know it hurts but it is the truth. Move on. __eou__ I do see that that's very likely, what I'm curious about is what are her motivations for doing so in the first place - why not just admit to me outright that she has a new one? Why not say she no longer wants to get back together upfront? What does she get from pretending we're still a thing? __eou__
[Serious] When your ex girlfriend immediately gets into a new relationship after breakup but does her best to hide it from you, mentions how she still wants to marry you and calls you every now and then asking if you miss her, what are your ex's intentions for doing so? __eou__ It seems that she is stringing you along to keep you on the side. She likes you, but she also wants to experiment with other people. Could be for any reason as well, like maybe she saw someone who she thought was more attractive, or you don't satisfy her sexual needs, or she liked how that person hit on her. She is stringing you along and you should just move along. If you aren't with somebody by the time she is finished with that dude, you could use her for sex. __eou__

[Serious] When your ex girlfriend immediately gets into a new relationship after breakup but does her best to hide it from you, mentions how she still wants to marry you and calls you every now and then asking if you miss her, what are your ex's intentions for doing so? __eou__ As a female, I can tell you 100% that she's hoping you're dumb enough to hold onto the small pieces of hope she's given you in the thought of staying by her side in case her new relationship doesn't work out or she needs attention. You deserve more than what she's giving you, so please don't allow yourself to be roped into her games __eou__ I see, so you mean that she wanted to keep me as insurance in case things failed for her new relationship? __eou__ Absolutely. I know all girls go through this stage when they first start having relationships, and most of us grow out of it, however some girls really are just so immature that that feel like they need constant attention, and when they're not getting it from the source they originally want it from (her current bf) she'll get it from her other choices that she knows will give it to her, her backup (you, in this case) You can start ignoring her now, and I guarantee that once she notices she'll start coming onto you really strong in the hopes to rope you in again, but you have to remain strong and do what's best for you __eou__ &gt; I guarantee that once she notices she'll start coming onto you really strong in the hopes to rope you in again Oh, for real? What are the chances she does that rather than actually moving on from me? If it helps for analysis, we were 4 and 1/2 year together before breaking up. __eou__ Honestly it's 50/50. From what I've gathered from your other replies, you've told her how you feel. She can either accept what you've said, or completely ignore you and go on with how she feels. Most of the time if they've already have a new s/o, and they're still talking to you, trying to act like they don't, they'll usually always react on the defensive and try and get you back. It's almost chick 101, it's that basic of a move. That being said, I don't know your ex, you do. Do you feel like she'll respect your wishes? __eou__ One thing I can say is that while she was still moving on from her past relationship before me during our earliest months together, she had a TON of attachment (caught her still talking to him on an alt account) to her ex despite having spent only 1 year with him and being cheated on by him. On the other hand I've been with her for 4 1/2 years and have never once cheated on her (no joking. I don't have the guts to look for random girls to flirt with). Makes me think she's probably gonna do the same to the new guy with me being the one she stays attached to, specially since her first and only sex ever so far was with me. __eou__ Since she's already set a precedent, I would say she would most likely attempt to rope you back in. I'm not too sure about the virginity thing, because in my opinion virginity is a social construct and I'd taken my virginity myself, long before any penis has, and while I never really had a romantic connection to the guy who "took" my virginity from me, it doesn't mean that guy friends that I've had, haven't complained about taking girls virginities and having them grown attached. __eou__
[Serious] When your ex girlfriend immediately gets into a new relationship after breakup but does her best to hide it from you, mentions how she still wants to marry you and calls you every now and then asking if you miss her, what are your ex's intentions for doing so? __eou__ It means she's insecure and needs an ego boost. If she can keep you on the hook it makes her feel valuable because somebody else wants her which gives her leverage in her current relationship don't fall for it if she left you once you can never trust her again because she will do it again. I personally also feel like if somebody immediately gets into relationship with someone after a break up they left you for that person they knew they weren't throwing away something for nothing __eou__
[Serious] When your ex girlfriend immediately gets into a new relationship after breakup but does her best to hide it from you, mentions how she still wants to marry you and calls you every now and then asking if you miss her, what are your ex's intentions for doing so? __eou__ She's unsure if she made a mistake so she's doing her level best to keep you on option if her new relationship blows up. You are insurance. Block her on social media, stop taking her calls, stop responding to her texts, and get on with your life. __eou__ Yeah, seems like that. It's hard but I know cutting her off is definitely best. __eou__
[Serious] When your ex girlfriend immediately gets into a new relationship after breakup but does her best to hide it from you, mentions how she still wants to marry you and calls you every now and then asking if you miss her, what are your ex's intentions for doing so? __eou__ You're her backup provider plan. __eou__
[Serious] When your ex girlfriend immediately gets into a new relationship after breakup but does her best to hide it from you, mentions how she still wants to marry you and calls you every now and then asking if you miss her, what are your ex's intentions for doing so? __eou__ Probably better suited for r/relationship. She sounds like a manipulator and bad news OP. __eou__ Already did, but some of the people there are jerks and focused on criticizing my reasons. Had some immature decisions for sure but didn't really like getting bashed when I'm already feeling down. She's been with me for 4 and 1/2 years, so while it was the best decision to let her go it's also pretty hard for me to adjust. __eou__ Yeah. R/relationships is like that. It's gonna be hard but it sounds like your her second option. I wish you the best. __eou__ Thanks, same to you. __eou__

[Serious] When your ex girlfriend immediately gets into a new relationship after breakup but does her best to hide it from you, mentions how she still wants to marry you and calls you every now and then asking if you miss her, what are your ex's intentions for doing so? __eou__ It means she is attempting to manipulate you and keep you on tow, so if her new found "love" doesn't work out she can jump ship back to you, say that it was a mistake to leave you, You'll always be the one for me, I never knew what i had until I didnt and every other movie cliche line. Best thing you can do is just move on. Don't concern yourself with her. Every time you think of her, do 10 push ups and think of something else. If you hate push ups you won't want to do them. If you love push ups at least you're getting a work out in. Seriously. Move the fuck on, do not concern yourself with it. Be polite and friendly if she talks to you, but as soon as you as a couple comes up, straight up ignore the topic and move on. It will only cause you more grief than it's worth and i promise you a year or two from now, this wont even be important to you any more. You'll remember it sure, but it will have lost all meaning. Move on. __eou__ Thanks man. You mentioned being polite and friendly if she talks to me - does that mean I should still answer if she calls? (we're an 11 hour bus ride apart so we can't meet eye to eye unless we visit the other). __eou__ That's your call man. If it were me, id say no. Itll just make it harder to separate yourself from them. If the nature of your calls is mainly her saying "i miss you", or complaining about stuff, then she just wants attention. Give her short answers and nothing to work off. If she starts talking about "that time we did x and you did y" etc, just say "I don't want to talk about that." And either finish the convo or talk about something else. The longer you speak to her the harder it will be to move on from her. Its up to you when you want to be ready to go on with your own life. But usually its better to start sooner rather then later in these situations. In case its not obvious this is from experience and I regret the amount of time I spent pining over women I didn't get back. __eou__ Cool, thanks. I'll take note of this and will apply it when the situation arises. __eou__

[Serious] In this time of uncertainty and depression in US Politics, what facts or story keep you positive and trudging on? __eou__ The simple fact is America's problems are structural and there's zero political will to do what needs done, or to even discuss what needs done. Our destruction is mathematically assured; the 20 Trillion debt ain't getting paid back, and the 200+ Trillion in promises won't be paid.

Mathematically shit ain't gonna get paid. Or if *it does get paid* then the $2500 per month Social Security income will just cover a bag of rice and a case of Alpo. They will default either through outright default, by cutting benefits drastically (and means testing! You've got 200K in your 401K because you scrimped and saved? They'll reduce you SS payment by 50%), or most likely through strong, steady inflation. __eou__

What is the scenario? __eou__ We lose the reserve currency, the dollar devalues by 50% overnight and suddenly our imports - including oil - double in price, for starters. Basically welcome to the second world. Hopefully they don't start a war to try to avoid it - dying leviathans often lash out violently. Google "triffin's dilemma" which will explain why the US **must** run a trade deficit (and lose her tax base and manufacturing) as long as she has the reserve currency. Next google "The petrodollar." Once OPEC begins to take gold, Euros, Yuan etc. for oil, there's no longer a need or demand for others to buy our Treasury Bonds. Once they quit, it's like cutting up America's Credit Card. If the Fed prints money to buy Treasuries - and it will, massive inflation will follow. __eou__

No matter how little or how much the Trump administration's words and actions have affected you, you are not alone. There are others like you, other people celebrating, other people mourning, other people cheering, other people crying. Whether or not you like what's going on, we can be fairly certain that we'll come out the other side. If things go well, then that's great. If they don't, then we'll have learned plenty of lessons on how to improve. But most of all, we've always got a chance to improve, and there's nowhere to go but up. __eou__ This helps a lot with the news bog-down. Thank you. __eou__ Not a problem, I've gotten accustomed to doing this for a lot of my friends the past couple weeks. I'm astonishingly lucky to be surrounded by the kind of people who do the same for me. __eou__ I completely understand. My wife is the one having a hard time. She's concerned about a lot of the changes going on, especially now that we're in the age-range where it's expected that not only do you have an opinion but fight for it, uphold it, seek out change. It's been an exhausting month. __eou__ I get the fatigue, believe me. I come from a circle where this is essentially day-in-day-out stuff for us and has been for even longer than the Trump presidency, this has just aggravated it further. Just gotta remember that this too shall pass, but only if we're making sure it does. __eou__

Tourists of Reddit, what is something you dislike about a country you've visited? __eou__ The graffiti in Greece makes a beautiful historic place ugly. I absolutely hated to see it. __eou__
Tourists of Reddit, what is something you dislike about a country you've visited? __eou__ I got catcalled several times in different cities during a 3-week visit to Spain. I don't know if that's really a Spanish thing or if I was just unlucky, though. I get the same shit at home in America, but less frequently. __eou__ Did they called you ''mamacita''? __eou__ No, it was mostly just stuff like "Oye, bonita! Hey! Americana! You pretty, nice titty!" The only time I got called a name was when I walked right past some jerk like he wasn't there and he muttered, "Gringa puta." EDIT: I was 16 and these were mostly grown-ass men doing this. Also, some asshole chased me into a men's bathroom THAT I HAD PERMISSION TO USE and actually banged on the stall door and threatened to call the cops. O_o I don't want to give the wrong idea about my general impression of the Spanish people, though. Most of them were very nice, polite, and patient with my lousy Spanish. Servers in restaurants had no problem with my being a vegetarian and a very helpful employee took the time to walk me back to my group when I got lost in the Picasso Museum. __eou__ How did they know you're american? __eou__ Not all of them would have, but I'm guessing the ones who did heard me and/or the group I was with speaking English with an American accent. __eou__ Planing to revisit Spain? __eou__ Nope. Too poor. EDIT: OH COME ON, WHO DOWNVOTED ME FOR BEING TOO POOR FOR INTERNATIONAL VACATIONS?! __eou__ Try Italy, here they'll call you "bella fica" __eou__ Thanks for the warning. I'll be sure to learn how to say "Fuck off" in Italian before I visit. ;) __eou__

I don't know if that's really a Spanish thing or if I was just unlucky, though. I get the same shit at home in America, but less frequently. __eou__ 'Catcalling' should be a criminal offence. Don't care if people think that sounds drastic. It's harmful and intimidating and disrupts social peace. __eou__ I disagree. Catcalling is very obnoxious and should absolutely be regarded with derision and shame, but legislating speech opens up a giant can of worms. __eou__ I agree it would be very hard to judge in a courtroom, but something needs to be done in the world regarding catcalling. I'm only 22 and since leaving school in a rural village, to university in the capital city, I'm horrified at how prevalent and common it is. __eou__ Yeah, it sucks. I'm ten years older than you and have been dealing with this shit for over 20 years, and it got old LONG ago. The best way to combat it is education. Talk to your brothers, male friends, male coworkers, etc. about this. Tell them how gross and alarming it is from a female perspective; and, as a last resort, how it makes them far less attractive to the vast majority of women and will almost certainly never get them laid. Some of these guys will never listen to you, but as we get more and more intelligent, sane men on our side, more and more sexist douchebags are being told by their buddies, "Bro, no." __eou__ Education, yes. That's it. It was something I never even heard referred to when I was growing up in school, I didn't know it existed. In schools, there needs to be an ongoing conservation about this and a campaign to eradicate it __eou__ I didn't mean in school, although a How Not To Be An Asshole In Public class isn't a bad idea. I meant peer-to-peer education. Educate your friends, get them to educate their friends, etc. __eou__
Tourists of Reddit, what is something you dislike about a country you've visited? __eou__ I'm generally accepting of other countries' cultures and ways of life but I hate the shit out of the transport in Italy, mainly buses. Not only does it use no schedule but you can't buy the tickets on the bus, you have to find a shop that sells them. Train tickets have to be stamped before you get on board, despite the ticket being proof you've paid. __eou__ &gt; can't buy the tickets on the bus, you have to find a shop that sells them. Yes you can. Ever seen those yellow ticket machines inside the bus? You can get them there, but they only accept small change. __eou__ Seriously? I didn't know this! I'm used to getting on board and scanning my ticket on those machines, I didn't know they had other uses! That's if we're talking about the same machine! __eou__ Dude. There's that small opening for inserting coins, above the scanner, then you press the green button to receive the ticket. __eou__ My bad! I'm usually that dickhead with a €20 note though haha. __eou__

What's something that teens/kids do that make you want to knock them out? __eou__ When I was a kid I used to hate when late teens/early 20s dudes blasted music from their cars with their friends outside of coffee shops. I'm 18 now, turned into one of those smh __eou__

What's something that teens/kids do that make you want to knock them out? __eou__ The excessive use of the term "bro" and the type of person that says it. Also thinking that they are invisible and above the law. __eou__

What's the best way for the good guys to combat the gender wage gap? __eou__ I think in general, talking about your salaries with your colleagues instead of keeping it a taboo is a good way to fight any kind of financial inequalities in the work place __eou__ [deleted] __eou__

What's the best way for the good guys to combat the gender wage gap? __eou__ Encourage women to enter jobs like construction, trash pickup or any infrastructure repair and finite resource gathering such as coal or oil. Seriously, these are great paying jobs that have very small numbers of women working them. And there is no reason they cant. __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ I think we found the answer. I want the same money, but no dangerous or yucky stuff!!! __eou__
What's the best way for the good guys to combat the gender wage gap? __eou__ Try learning real facts first. Good guys don't blindly follow propaganda. __eou__

What is the weirdest movie you have ever seen? __eou__ The Cobbler by Adam Sandler Starts off in a semi-serious drama about his dying business and how the neighborhood is getting gentrified.

Turns out his dad is alive and are in a group of secret cobbler society that do things in the name of justice. __eou__
What is the weirdest movie you have ever seen? __eou__ Mulholland Drive To this day, I'm sure that guy made that movie as a "fuck you" to Movie snobs to make them try and invent theories about what it was supposed to be about or what it was supposed to mean. __eou__ It's possibly David Lynch's most coherent and accessible film. Spoilers ahead: the first half of the movie is a dream, the second half is reality. And chronologically they should be reversed. Naomi Watts' character comes to Hollywood with big dreams of being a star. Reality is she can only get shitty roles as an extra, the woman she loves has moved onto a man and rubs it in her face. With her life spiraling out of control she puts a hit on her former lover. Then she dreams of the life she wanted, where her talent is breathtaking and her lover needs her, and the man her lover left her for gets his comeuppance personally and professionally. Then she goes insane with guilt and blows her head off. __eou__

Men of Reddit: what's a question you've always had regarding women? __eou__ Nothing because I don't want to hear them speak. __eou__ Speak or type? __eou__ How about both. __eou__ Ok, then I should probably stop. __eou__ Yeah that's a good idea. You need fucking permission if you want to speak to me. __eou__ I don't need permission! I can talk to you any time, I just don't want to. __eou__ Permission denied.

Men of Reddit: what's a question you've always had regarding women? __eou__ Why are their hands *always* so damn cold? __eou__ because we loose the blood supposed to go to our hands when we have our periods __eou__ So pregnant women have warm hands then? __eou__ no because then the blood goes to their baby __eou__ So women after menopause will have warm hands then? __eou__ yes. now you go find that GILF __eou__
Men of Reddit: what's a question you've always had regarding women? __eou__ Why are their hands *always* so damn cold? __eou__ Women generally have poorer circulation than men, so our hand and feet are colder.

Men of Reddit: what's a question you've always had regarding women? __eou__ Why do obese women demand that we validate their shitty dietary and lifestyle choices by calling them "beautiful", through their "only a real man can handle my curves" bullshit posts, when if an obese man were to adopt a similar mentality he would justly be told to hit the gym and better himself and women wouldn't pass the time of day with him? __eou__ they are told the same things tho __eou__ I've never seen that. When I see women post those "proud of my XXXL body" type of posts, all I see on them are other women and broken men commenting with crap like "I really admire your confidence, you're so beautiful!" __eou__ I've seen a lot of posts about how skinny guys are like a skeleton and real guys are chubby or some dove men campains about body diversity for men __eou__ I've encountered a lot of posts mocking skinny men too, but just as many mocking fat men. I haven't seen those campaigns, but then I live in New Zealand. __eou__ [I still find articles like that all the time tho](http://thoughtcatalog.com/jen-anderson/2015/10/10-perks-of-dating-a-chubby-guy-that-women-need-to-know-about/) __eou__

Maybe people don't *try* to have them, but the message is that guys that have them can still be sexy. And fat dudes on TV get these skinny, attractive wives, even if they're lazy or rude (King of Queens, family Guy, According to Jim, etc. __eou__ Really? I live in New Zealand and I've seen lots of people talking about how to lose the dad bod over these last couple of years. I don't really watch sitcoms, mostly BBC dramas, but shows like the ones you listed are popular here and still their influence in that regard doesn't seem to have rubbed off on our population. __eou__
Men of Reddit: what's a question you've always had regarding women? __eou__ How the fuck can they think men are complicated? We have roughly 5 thoughts a day and 3 of them are sex, food, and sex __eou__ (F here) I dunno about "complicated," so much as we just can't understand many of the differences that come with what gender you are. Men's brains are different from women's, and so when y'all do something that's natural for a guy, for us it's like ??????? I imagine the same applies the other way around, too. Sometimes I get those moments where I'm like "*why* the hell do guys do this?" but that's just how it is. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ __eou__

Men of Reddit: what's a question you've always had regarding women? __eou__ Why is there always a competition between other girls and themselves? __eou__ Not always.

Men of Reddit: what's a question you've always had regarding women? __eou__ Why in seven hells can you not decide what you want to eat? __eou__ What if that turned out to be the last meal? The prospect of that just makes the whole choice so... overwhelming and difficult. __eou__
Men of Reddit: what's a question you've always had regarding women? __eou__ Why in seven hells can you not decide what you want to eat? __eou__ Speaking for myself, I usually genuinely don't care. Like.... It is of no consequence to me, so we might as well go where you want to go. __eou__
Men of Reddit: what's a question you've always had regarding women? __eou__ Why in seven hells can you not decide what you want to eat? __eou__ A friend of mine told me something he claimed will make my life much easier. Girls don't know what they want. Later I realized guys also don't know what they want. So if you accept that fact that no one knows what they want, your life will be easier and things make a lot more sense! __eou__
Men of Reddit: what's a question you've always had regarding women? __eou__ Why in seven hells can you not decide what you want to eat? __eou__ I do, but sometimes I try to be coy about it so I don't seem too demanding...other times I'm going where I want to go lol __eou__

What's your most ridiculous (or overthought) social anxiety? __eou__ That no one likes me in the slightest, just only barely tolerates me. I know that's a common one, but it is the most common thought I have and it extends to everyone from my SO to my family. __eou__
What's your most ridiculous (or overthought) social anxiety? __eou__ I hate having to eat at someone's place because I'm terrified of not liking the food they prepared and ending up turning it down or struggling to eat it __eou__

What's your most ridiculous (or overthought) social anxiety? __eou__ I hate talking on the phone. There's so many appointments I need to make (I have one for a free massage, mani, pedi, and facial) and I haven't been because I'm too scared to make an appointment by calling. __eou__
What's your most ridiculous (or overthought) social anxiety? __eou__ Paranoia makes me think people are going to stab me if we walk too close. Social anxiety alone, I feel like I'm inhumanly ugly and people are either not looking out of awkwardness, or looking because I'm so ugly. I combat this by wearing green, blue or purple lipstick and having interesting hair styles. If I give them something to look at, I don't feel like they're staring because of things I can't change. __eou__ I have a deep fear of people being too close to me. It makes life a nightmare and I have no idea why or where this fear came from but it can be crippling some days. __eou__ Are you diagnosed with anything? Paranoid PD, schizophrenia, bipolar with psychosis, etc? __eou__ So far just GAD, OCD and depression. I'm actually going to get evaluated and diagnosed soon because that can't just be regular anxiety __eou__
What's your most ridiculous (or overthought) social anxiety? __eou__ That if I say something that is strange or out of place that people will ignore me or avoid me when I say something else, which causes me to be quiet most of the time, go figure. __eou__
What's your most ridiculous (or overthought) social anxiety? __eou__ Yesterday I was too anxious to say hi to a new girl in my class. She even smiled at me when I walked into the room. Fuck anxiety. __eou__
What's your most ridiculous (or overthought) social anxiety? __eou__ When you text someone and they don't reply within 30 minutes. Instant regret kicks in, even over the simplest things. __eou__
What's your most ridiculous (or overthought) social anxiety? __eou__ That people, both strangers and those who love me, are waiting to humiliate me and prove no one really cares about me or my feelings. __eou__
What's your most ridiculous (or overthought) social anxiety? __eou__ That everyone hates me and thinks I'm a total loser __eou__
What's your most ridiculous (or overthought) social anxiety? __eou__ Whenever I'm shopping I get the feeling that the people near me hate me. Super weird feeling, only when I'm shopping alone and I can't shake it __eou__

I am a very open minded guy, but the history shows how the next generation always surprise. __eou__ Yeah, I know what you mean. I'm sure many good parents will have an adaptive period though. My family didn't support my life choices initially (especially because they deviated so greatly from their expectations). But after they saw that I was actually doing pretty well in life and was actually happy, they came around. __eou__

what are some types of technology, genetics etc. that are widely researched for curing cancer? __eou__ Cannabis oil __eou__
what are some types of technology, genetics etc. that are widely researched for curing cancer? __eou__ Hair stroking and saying 'there there' __eou__
what are some types of technology, genetics etc. that are widely researched for curing cancer? __eou__ CAR-T cells. There's a company called Kite pharmaceuticals that is one of several working on something analogous to an autologous stem cell transplant. Instead of using stem cells, though, they use T-cells. In theory, they engineer/do magic to your T-cells, and infuse them back into your body after an intense round of chemotherapy and hope they'll cure you. Seems to be more successful with leukemias and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. It has a decent success rate with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma too. It can be dangerous, though. __eou__ https://www.statnews.com/2017/02/28/cancer-car-t-kite/ __eou__
what are some types of technology, genetics etc. that are widely researched for curing cancer? __eou__ Another big thing right now is immunotherapy. Drugs like nivolumab and pembrolizumab. They're testing them in relapsed lymphoma, both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin. Interestingly, you can see an initial "flare" that looks like the disease is getting worse, but if the drug is working, then the flare will go away and so will the lymphoma. I can's speak to long-term success rates, though. They're still very new. Pembrolizumab brand name is Keytruda, and it's made by Merck. They've used it in lung cancer, pancreatic, myeloma, leukemias, lymphomas, you name it. Big side-effects are the '-itis' (pancreatitis, hepatitis) and things like hyper/hypothyroidism. __eou__
what are some types of technology, genetics etc. that are widely researched for curing cancer? __eou__ Okay, last one -- we have a proton beam thing where I work. I know VERY little about it, but it has some advantages over regular radiotherapy. Regular RT tends to have the highest energy where it penetrates your skin, which can burn and sometimes not reach all of the tumor. It's really effective despite its side effects. But the proton beam can be calibrated to an exact depth where the energy peaks and then falls off -- so you can shape the beam so it doesn't hit vital organs. They like it for disease in the brain, spine, and around the heart. It's expensive as shit, and in a lot of areas of the body, not necessarily better than regular RT. But it's pretty cool. __eou__

Why do news outlets report in such bias fashions yet claim to be "non-bias"? __eou__ Pretty much all of them __eou__
Why do news outlets report in such bias fashions yet claim to be "non-bias"? __eou__ My god shut the fuck up who cares. __eou__ People who want to be accurately-informed do. __eou__ That's great. You and all those people can have tin foil hat parties too. __eou__ Labeling all the people the MSM disagrees with or is biased against as tin foil hat wearers, you're pathetic in your methods. You'd fit in just with the rest of them at CNN. __eou__ Yes I would like a turkey sandwich right about now. __eou__
Why do news outlets report in such bias fashions yet claim to be "non-bias"? __eou__ Group think is pretty closed minded. Nobody embraces differing opinions in the political world. It's either your right or your wrong. I think that's why news outlets are so bias. They only serve their targeted audience. __eou__
Why do news outlets report in such bias fashions yet claim to be "non-bias"? __eou__ Because most enjoy hearing confirmation of what they already "know", but also want to believe that they're not just tuning in to an echo chamber. Add in how "edgy" the views (*their* views) parroted back to them are, and you pretty much have the holy trifecta of news ratings. __eou__
Why do news outlets report in such bias fashions yet claim to be "non-bias"? __eou__ All news is biased. All people are biased. Information presented in all but the most straight-forward and austere way manner contains the bias of the speaker or writer. Of course, I suppose it’s possible to be so entirely ignorant of a subject as to make bias impossible. When people hear the word “bias,” they often think of someone who holds opinions and values that don’t reinforce their own. That’s bad. But, it’s not that people don’t actually want bias. In fact, they demand it. That’s why conservatives (or what once passed for conservatives) prefer the Wall Street Journal and National Review and liberals prefer the New York Times and The Nation. __eou__

How did you gain weight? __eou__ Food doesn't judge. It doesn't complain, it doesn't lie to you. Food doesn't care if you're pretty, or funny, or smart.

What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ On TI-83/84 etc calculators, you could make your own programs. In the program editor, I would write all my notes for the exam. If you tried to open the program, it wouldn't run and it would just look like nothing was supposed to happen. If you went in to edit, there were all my notes. __eou__ A scientific calculator was required for most of my college courses for this specific reason. I did the same thing as you in HS though. __eou__

If you tried to open the program, it wouldn't run and it would just look like nothing was supposed to happen.

This was off the actual TI website too. __eou__

If you tried to open the program, it wouldn't run and it would just look like nothing was supposed to happen. If you went in to edit, there were all my notes. __eou__ Same here. But went one more step - actually programmed my calculator to answer the questions and show me full working out as well. Sure, I had to know how to actually solve the problems to make the programs for the calculator, but during a test you can forget things or make mistakes. __eou__

Nobody ever checked my calculator though so the clever ruse I spent hours figuring out how to program ended up being pointless. :( __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ In the days before you could access the internet at large on most cell phones, I used to rip texts to Cha-Cha during my biology tests asking complicated questions about really specific biology stuff, like the anatomy of a lobster, how ATP is made and stuff like that. And by god if Cha Cha didn't save my ass and text me back some really accurate answers. __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ I have a friend who goes and consults the syllabus, then reads the textbook and does questions relevant to the test enough to store all the answers in his head, then goes into the test and puts in on the paper. Get's stupid high marks that way, honestly can't wrap my head around it. __eou__

What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ I was taking a drivers ed course at 16. During this course we were allowed to listen to music no problem. Felt that there were way too many fucking things to memeorize. Got mad. Figured out a plan. I got a hold of the answer key for the final test. Recorded my voice speaking all the answers. Burned the recording onto a CD. Listened to 'music' during the final exam (we were allowed to). Passed with 95%. Not 100%. I felt like I needed to miss a couple to really pull it off. __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ I would memorize my teachers lunch schedules and then sneak into their classroom and steal graded assignments from other students that were in the filing cabinet. :l __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ I only cheated once. It was eight grade and I attended a private christian school. It was bible class and we had a quiz over a few bible verses we had to write down from memory. When I walked into class, the person in front of me always would take off their jacket and place it on the back of their chair. Their hood would drape over the seat so I placed a notecard in his hood so I could just look up and read the verses and write them down. But I was so nervous during the quiz that I probably only read about half the notecard before I quit, and I never cheated again. It wasn't even because I felt "guilty" its just because I suck at cheating honestly. __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ My best friend in high school used to write the answers on cd's and then put them in her discman. for some reason we were allowed to listen to music during tests so if she needed a different cd it was no big deal to just casually pop one in. __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ One teacher thought he was clever by having students randomly swap desks before a test, so you couldn't have notes scribbled on the dark desks. You could write lightly and have it not be seen unless the light hit it just right. What he did not count on was the student getting there early, before him even, and writing on all 25 desks. I only saw the end of it, but bravo. __eou__

What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ I wear a paracord band at all times, to be specific a dragon's claw braid(this will be important later), and I'd take a copy of the answer that a friend got for me, shrink it down and hide it in the underside of my paracord band, I'd have a small thread tied to one end of the paper and feed that through to the top, then pull to reveal the answers as needed. I over complicated things too much I think __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ We sat at typewriters, yes that long ago. We had to take a test and my friends were dumb. It was multiple choice I hit space bar once for a, twice for b, etc.. my teacher was kinda dumb too. Thank God Google didn't exist when I was in school, I also turned in song lyrics for the poetry section in English. I would also do it for my friends, I was wrote the doors' Texas highway for my friend, she got an A. __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ We were allowed to use a dictionary at any time in my civic class, due to our teacher deducting points for incorrect spelling. So someone would sneak a cheat sheet into a specific dictionary that many people knew about, and if you got stuck, you could always check that. __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ Used to write notes on tissues. Pulled it out of my pocket, got what I needed, and blew my nose. You think I'm cheating? Go ahead and look. __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ I took all my exams on a computer, so I memorised the high scoring theories and authors and year of publication. Logged on whilst the lecturer got their exam papers together. I opened word, set my font to white and typed everything I remembered. We'd get the exam papers and the exam speech. And I'd make an answering plan and unhide the white text. __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ In high school I got away with writing definitions or equations on the label of my water bottle or drink of choice once or twice, but really took advantage of writing equations on the lid of my scientific calculator the most. The calculator came with an instruction card that popped in and out of the lid, so I just wrote my equations underneath it. __eou__

What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ I don't know, crib sheets always seems amateurish to me. I would always try to get a hold of the test before hand. I always had friends in band who were older and some who kept their old tests. Many times this worked out well. And once I stole a copy of a test from a filing cabinet during lunch. With term papers I would just take someone's old one and write it in my own words and change the bibliography a bit. Rinse wash repeat. __eou__

What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ I have a skin condition(?) that makes me get welts from even small scratches. So the period before a quiz/test, i would just use a mechanical pencil and write small cheat sheets on the inside of my arms. Was never caught __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ I had a binder that was purple, but transparent.

What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ I've only ever programmed shit into my calculator but I also don't consider it cheating. __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ I had a test in History one morning, and I was supposed to write some long-ass essay about Martin Luther (of Lutheran/Theses fame) and I didn't know shit about him because I had history at 7:30 in the fucking morning. I got an A+ on that essay, and here's how: I was looking around the room looking for a distraction, when I found some fortune on the bulletin board! There was a lengthy passage of Luther and his whole situation aside some pictures of him, and it was a good distance away, but my eyesight is so fucking good that I managed to read it. It took some serious squinting, but I succeeded and handed in my paper. After we got the tests back and my ONLY A in that class was secured, all the stuff was taken off that bulletin board. I don't know if it was because the unit was over or if she found out, and took it down after the fact, but it was one of my proudest achievements in cheating in high school. __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ I used to write answers on my thigh that would be covered by my school skirt. Not like a teacher could ask to look at my thighs or pull my skirt up. __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ I went to Catholic school and had to wear a skirt. I would write answers on an index card, place it on the chair, then sit down. During the test, I'd open my legs to see the card in between them. No one questioned why you were looking down and teachers couldn't crack it because that would involve looking at a female students crotch! Worked every time and never got caught. __eou__
What are the most creative ways you've cheated in school? __eou__ Write the formulas I need to remember on my legs. If a question comes up where I can't remember the formula, ask to go to the bathroom, then check the formulas in the stall. __eou__ Why the hell wouldn't you just write it on paper and put it in your pocket?? __eou__

[serious] Cafeteria workers, do the "chefs" think their food is good, or are they doing the best they can with what they're given? What's the strangest thing you've had to serve with a straight face? __eou__ I was a frequent volunteer during primary school helping the cafeteria workers clean and serve food. They have no illusions about the food they're serving. They're just trying to feed as many kids as they can with what food the school supplies. __eou__
[serious] Cafeteria workers, do the "chefs" think their food is good, or are they doing the best they can with what they're given? What's the strangest thing you've had to serve with a straight face? __eou__ As far as the military goes oversees...at a command post level the food was just enough to give you a turd and sometimes one would just assume to eat an MRE rather than stand in line. When you broke it down to battalion level...it could either be pretty good or the same as above depending on pride of the lead enlisted chef (usually E-7). When KBR rolled in, the food was much better. When that got subbed out to TCN's, things became restaurant quality in most cases. I think a lot of it has to to with mindset. In the military, cooks are generally dismissed as whelps (except for by grunts. Grunts know what is important). KBR brought in a lot of "grillmen". By that I mean people that were happy to be cooking. Probably would have done it for half pay or maybe for nothing, they just loved grilling. The TCN's though, they were grilling with a purpose. They were making maybe $4-5 dollars a day, working breakfast to midrats. These folks went all out because it was basically an audition to get picked up for a U.S. contract or a private agency. So, when you ask if a cafeteria chef thinks their food is good, i would answer that some don't care and others will self flog over criticism. That reminds me...i need to look up whoever made those pecan pies at the LSA. Gained 5 pounds in 2 weeks __eou__

Have you ever told someone they were being cheated on and what happened? __eou__ I actually know that someone is cheating on their SO behind their back, but it's not my place to say anything. __eou__
Have you ever told someone they were being cheated on and what happened? __eou__ I wish someone would have told me upfront when it happened to me. __eou__
Have you ever told someone they were being cheated on and what happened? __eou__ I have never told a person that they were cheated on, but I have told a cheater I knew they were cheating on their partner. They admitted to it after a few days. I'm glad because they managed to sort it out maturely among themselves. __eou__
Have you ever told someone they were being cheated on and what happened? __eou__ Told my mom her husband was cheating on her. She didn't believe me. I had and still have insomnia. I was awake when he left the house after she fell asleep. I was awake when he came home. There was nothing that when on at night, in that neighborhood that I didn't know about. He would leave his wedding ring behind. I would hide it. She finally left him after his alleged best friend told her, that her husband was in fact, fucking his secretary. __eou__
Have you ever told someone they were being cheated on and what happened? __eou__ Once in high school I told my good buddy I had solid info that his girlfriend was hooking up with her ex behind his back. I went straight to him the next day and he ended up confronting her about it and of course she denied it. So he came after me and we almost got into a fist fight because he was pissed I made such an accusation. A week or less later they split because she was hooking up with her ex behind his back. Moral of the story is I won't ever do that again. __eou__
Have you ever told someone they were being cheated on and what happened? __eou__ In college a buddy of mine was really whipped and believed anything his GF would tell him. I saw her several times at parties grinding up against guys and walking hand in hand to other guy's rooms. I've even caught her doing the walk of shame a few times from my dorm window. I wasn't super close friends with the guy, but we had a lot of friends in common and I saw him fairly regularly. I consulted with the other boys in the group about what to do and they all said I should just be upfront with the guy. Anyways, I mustered the courage and pulled the guy aside to tell him. My arms were totally spaghetti when I was doing it just because I was so nervous about his reaction. He didn't believe me and basically said something along the lines of how I was trying to sabotage a beautiful thing because I was jealous of what he had. He was really pissed at me and even shoved me. I didn't bring it up again after that, but apparently he had his suspicions. He confronted his girl about it a few days later. She of course denied it and somehow convinced him that all those instances when I saw her were just coincidences. They kept on dating for a while and I sort of lost respect for the guy for not standing up for himself. Anyways about 3-4 months later he told his GF he would be going home for the long weekend, but in reality planned a lame surprise of some kind for her. Yes exactly what you think will happen, happened. He came up to her room with flowers and when she opened the door he found her in a bathrobe and some dude under the covers, clothes all over the floor. He even said he smelled the "stank" in the air! I went to a pretty small school so news of this spread like wildfire all over campus. I felt really bad for the guy because everybody was discussing his business no matter where he went. On the bright side his soon to be ex-GF was given the moniker "Nut-gobbler" if that was of any consolation. The name stuck for the rest of college. He earned my respect back when he apologized to me a few days afterwards. He actually ended up crying on my shoulder. I have to say, having a grown man crying like a helpless baby in front of you is not a very pretty sight. What really earned my respect for him is that he didn't let this incident bring him down. He started to learn game, went to the gym, and basically stopped being a weenie. Surprisingly he didn't become jaded or disrespectful towards women, just more conscious and assertive. When we were graduating he was dating a really nice girl who loved him and took good care of him. I haven't really stayed in touch with him since we left college, but last I heard he has a successful business and is married to the girl he was with when we graduated. I guess it was one of those silver lining type of experiences that he had such a bad breakup. At first I really thought I made a big mistake by telling him. After all it wasn't really any of my business, especially since I wasn't privy to the ins and outs of their relationships. But after the whole incident came to light, I was glad I did it. TL:DR - I told the guy he was being cheated on, he didn't believe me. Then a few months later caught his GF in bed with another dude. Transformed, improved himself, and is now successful. __eou__
Have you ever told someone they were being cheated on and what happened? __eou__ Yep. A friend let me know my roommate's boyfriend was being friendly with his genitals when she went home for Christmas break. Her boyfriend was his frat brother so I had no reason to think he would lie. I told my roommate, said it was her choice to believe me or not, and left it alone. She chose to believe him, we haven't spoken since the end of that semester, and, as far as I know, are still together 8 years later. I don't regret telling her because my intentions were good and I didn't keep a secret from my friend. __eou__

How did you know you were ready to have kids? __eou__ I didn't - then it happened - then i loved it. __eou__ Awww this makes my heart happy __eou__ They went from the dirty little germ bag rascals I would never have wanted before having kids to almost immediately they pop out to the dirty little germ bags that I love to death more than anything! Its funny, no matter how many people would have said that crap to me before having kids, i was just like "yeah yeah i get it" (i didn't) - then you have kids and its like BOOM : oh yeah, so ***that's*** what they were talkin about. edit: for clarity. __eou__
How did you know you were ready to have kids? __eou__ I didn't - then it happened - then i loved it. __eou__ Awww this makes my heart happy __eou__ People always tell me that if you wait till you feel ready it will never happen __eou__ probably true - i don't know. I once met a 'flying doctor' (a pilot who was a doctor who had such a business in ireland) and he told me about his first child : it was born, he was there for the birth, but having done SO MANY before he felt ***nothing***. It took im 3 months of 'nothing' until the baby grabbed his finger once and looked right at him - he said thats when it hit, all at once, like the flood gates opened ... and from that moment he was irreversibly smitten. Others its immediate (like for me) - but I think the consus is it ***does happen***, eventually - once you have kids. __eou__
How did you know you were ready to have kids? __eou__ My wife told me we were starting a family. __eou__
How did you know you were ready to have kids? __eou__ You don't. Anyone who feels ready on anything but a financial level is doomed to fail as a parent. Good parents to be, always question whether or not they're cut out to be a fit parent, then they question whether they are making the right decisions by their kids. The bad parents to be, feel ready for kids and then are always confident in what they do as a parent. __eou__

He wanted us to understand that no matter what side of a topic you're on, you should always understand both sides and that sometimes scientists disagree with each other. I believe in global warming, but there's a lot of shit people throw out there that's heavily misleading about the environment on both sides of the subject. __eou__ ^^^^*triggered __eou__

How much do you think a one of a kind signature of Osborne E. Smith is worth? __eou__ So my parents found a casino card that has Ozzie Smith's signature on it. It's not the usual "Ozzie Smith" signature, it's signed "Osborne E. Smith". My parents saw Ozzie Smith in the casino and watched him walk by, so we know it's from the baseball player and not some joe schmoe with the same name. We were planning on selling it but we really don't know what to ask, since it's literally a one of a kind item. __eou__

To make things worse I'd probably get as stoned as possible and then venture outside to find no-one around. I'd go back inside, smoke more make a drink and then think about the implications of the situation __eou__

Users of Reddit, what's the scariest physical symptom you've ever experienced? __eou__ I went blind. I was reading an article on my laptop when everything started to get blurry.

I called my brother and he drove me to the hospital. As we waited in the ER for about 3hrs, the searing/throbbing pain kicked in and I found out it was a migraine. I ended up getting an IV drip, hearing a horrible miscarriage story from my roommate and going home. I had never had that happen before or since, but my brother gets migraines all the time. __eou__ I had something similar! I thought I was experiencing an afterimage from looking at a bright light. But it didn't go away, it got bigger and moved. Then I could no longer see anything in my right hand peripheral vision. I thought I was having a stroke. Nope, just a migraine with an aura. I haven't had an aura since. __eou__

That was the worst feeling I've ever had, heart constantly racing, my brain wouldn't shut off, just obsessive thoughts over and over again. Scariest moments of my life. __eou__ My grandmother was recently diagnosed with the same thing, she complained of the same symptoms, it sounds terrifying. __eou__
Users of Reddit, what's the scariest physical symptom you've ever experienced? __eou__ I've had 3 asthma attacks that I thought for sure I would die from. The most recent started at work and I didn't think much of it until my inhaler ran out. I was close to the end of my shift with a 20 minute drive to get home I figured I would be fine. It wasn't getting any better and my chest muscles and back muscles started to tense up and was causing me a lot of pain. By the time I pulled in my driveway I was gasping for air on the verge of passing out. Thankfully I got to my nebulizer in time and my wife rubbed my muscles to loosen them up enough so I could start catching my breath. It was a good 30 minutes to 45 before I was back to normal. I've never been so scared. __eou__ Damn, that's a scary one alright. My mother always said to carry two just incase! __eou__ I'm going to have to. My biggest downfall is my lack of insurance at the moment. __eou__
Users of Reddit, what's the scariest physical symptom you've ever experienced? __eou__ Vitreous hemmorage in my left eye.

If I see no one, then I'm up $20 I guess. __eou__

[Serious] You find a $20 note on the floor of a convenience store and it's not clear who dropped it what do you do? __eou__ I found a wallet one time and I was gonna keep it, rather than return it, but I thought: "Well, if I lost a hundred and fifty dollars, how would I feel?" And I realized I would want to be taught a lesson. __eou__

[Serious] You find a $20 note on the floor of a convenience store and it's not clear who dropped it what do you do? __eou__ I pick it up immediately and look around. If I see someone looking for it, I return it to the proper owner. If not, I take it and use it for a good cause, preferably something that benefits a stranger (because I think that'd be most appropriate), but realistically if one of my friends needed something, I'd use the money for them first because I'm selfish like that. __eou__

[Serious] You find a $20 note on the floor of a convenience store and it's not clear who dropped it what do you do? __eou__ Honestly, I would first find out if anyone was looking for it. Probably do this for about 15 minutes or so. If no one comes in or/and looks like they're looking for a dropped $20, then I would be that kind of douchebag, buy something with it (we are at a convenience store, after all), and pocket the rest if I hadn't used all $20. __eou__

Can on object accelerate directly from 0kph to 5kph without passing the intermediate speeds - why is/isn't this possible? __eou__ No. Because physics. __eou__

Can on object accelerate directly from 0kph to 5kph without passing the intermediate speeds - why is/isn't this possible? __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ Thanks, brilliant explanation. Any explanation why the speed of light has that characteristic? I think I should try figure that out first before I try figure out how to travel to the speed of light. __eou__ [deleted] __eou__
Can on object accelerate directly from 0kph to 5kph without passing the intermediate speeds - why is/isn't this possible? __eou__ Wait what if you move a 2 ton block of iron at 5kph into a small ball. Wouldn't that force the ball to move at the same speed as the block? __eou__ No. The block would move at a slightly slower speed. It might be 4.9999 or something but it would be slower. __eou__
Can on object accelerate directly from 0kph to 5kph without passing the intermediate speeds - why is/isn't this possible? __eou__ Newton's Second Law describes this problem: Whenever there is a net force acting on an object (a result of overall unbalanced forces) it will accelerate. An example of this is a falling object where the overwhelming force is of a downwards direction, a result of gravity. The object will accelerate in this direction. The difference in two speeds will always take up a certain amount of time, where all of the intermediate speeds are also made. It is not possible to simply jump between different speeds, even in a vacuum. __eou__
Can on object accelerate directly from 0kph to 5kph without passing the intermediate speeds - why is/isn't this possible? __eou__ No, instantaneous movement/stopping is not physically possible. When an object is changing velocity, it is accelerating (whether it is speeding up or slowing down), and acceleration is defined as change in velocity over unit time. If time is zero, you are dividing by zero, and the result is undefined. If such a thing happened, the G force experienced by the object would be infinite, which would crush it out of existence. And if nothing else, no event in the real universe can occur in less than Planck time. __eou__
Can on object accelerate directly from 0kph to 5kph without passing the intermediate speeds - why is/isn't this possible? __eou__ It is not possible; here is the theory behind it. Newton's Second Law: Force = mass * acceleration = mass * d(velocity)/d(time) - where d(velocity)/d(time) is the derivative of velocity with respect to time. If the velocity changed instantaneously (such as jumping from 0kph to 5kph), then the value of d(velocity)/d(time) would be infinite (think of this as the rate of change of the velocity). Since we know that mass cannot be infinite (at least in classical mechanics), we must assume an infinite value of acceleration to make this fundamental equation work. However, having an infinite acceleration on an object isn't possible in the physical world - you can't accelerate something infinitely because the bonds between atoms would split apart. Therefore, an object in classical mechanics cannot accelerate instantaneously from 0kph to 5kph without going through the values in between. Source: Mechanical Engineer __eou__
What would it be like if educators and schools prioritized emotional intelligence/awareness classes? __eou__ The exact same it is now. The education system doesn't matter whatsoever. __eou__ [deleted] __eou__
What would it be like if educators and schools prioritized emotional intelligence/awareness classes? __eou__ The exact same it is now. The education system doesn't matter whatsoever. __eou__ The average college grad makes more than the average high school grad, and the average high school grad makes more than the average high school dropout. Its flawed, but it still matters. __eou__ That is because some college majors learn useful skills. That has nothing to do with the impact it has on how people act towards each other. __eou__ I didn't know you were referring to how people treat one another. Thats obviously an issue, but I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the education system, though __eou__

What would it be like if educators and schools prioritized emotional intelligence/awareness classes? __eou__ Maybe not prioritize but I think if health classes in middle school and/or high school focused on this topic then there would be a lot less students with mental health issues. Or it may backfire and create a school of sociopaths. __eou__ Not less students with issues, just more that know how to handle themselves and get real help __eou__
What would it be like if educators and schools prioritized emotional intelligence/awareness classes? __eou__ When you lost your job you'd be OK with it. __eou__
What would it be like if educators and schools prioritized emotional intelligence/awareness classes? __eou__ Include into the curriculum? I think it would make easier for students to realize when to get help and whatnot. Prioritize? The next generations could have participation trophy syndrome, unable to work independently because they mistake simple lack of interest for an emotional disability and search for help. __eou__

In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin.

Every fucking year for a month before and a month after Halloween. A smoke bomb even landed on me and burned my skirt through once :( When the bus drivers told them off they used to just swear and act like they owned the place. One day we had a bus driver who just drove the bus to the police station when that shit started, and a few of the kids who were throwing the fireworks were crying when they got taken off the bus by police. The buses had CCTV too, so they couldn't even deny it. I was so glad when my older sister started driving and I could get lifts with her instead of going on the bus. __eou__

So we got off the bus and walked to school. __eou__
Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ The driveway to our elementary school had (and still has) a sewer drain that causes the driveway to dip a little. My favorite times on the bus were asking the bus driver to speed a little over the dip, so us kids in the back could get a sensation of weightlessness. There was also the time where we had a substitute bus driver (also in elementary school) who almost took us to the wrong school. Got over the train tracks (we didn't go over the tracks to get to school) when we pointed it out to her. Had to turn into a parking lot and head back to the correct school, causing us to be like 10 minutes late or something. __eou__

Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ One time this kid Dana, who looked identical to Donkeylips from Salute Your Shorts (just look it up), was dared to drink an entire room temperature 2 liter bottle of coke before we got to his stop. This kid chugged the entire bottle down like an absolute champion. At almost the instant his face could form a smug grin of satisfaction from a job well done, he proceeded to barf a borderline fountain of foamy sticky soda all over two dozen terrified kids on the bus. It's as if his entire stomach was filled with rolls of Mentos, which was possible considering the candy was at its commercial peak at the time. I mean the force of this thing could have put out a house fire. His arch reached over like four rows of seats and was sprayed wildly back and forth like a diabetic sprinkler system as he struggled to reign control from this carbonated demonic nightmare. The bus driver had to stop the bus to attend to the frightened children, and made a short but sincere effort to pat dry those poor souls caught in ground zero with government grade paper towels. I've never seen anything quite like it, and I'm afraid I may never again. Well done, Dana. Edit: Thank you for the gold! __eou__

Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ My siblings and I went to a small private school that was about a half an hour from home. We were the only kids on the bus that went to that school, the rest got dropped off at a public school first, and we were the last off at night. Needless to say we spent more time with the driver, Tom, then the other kids did. He favored us. After all the other kids got off, he'd let us move around the bus, sweep the floor, or pick the radio station. At Christmas time he would share his treats that the other kids gave him as gifts. He was awesome. I'll always remember Tom the bus driver. __eou__
Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ Not sure why this stuck with me but this was during the cooler months that you would just crack the windows a bit to get fresh air. We would play "football" (triangle paper kind) by "kicking" it back and forth. I kicked it one time and it went out the window. The window only open far enough that it could barely slide through on the side. It flew BACK into the bus 7 windows down, also through a window that was barely open enough to have it fit through. Hit a guy in the face. Was extremely bizarre. *edit* So weird that a little insignificant memory from my childhood would resonate with Reddit so much. It seriously is one of those memories that I don't know WHY I remember it. __eou__
Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ I was in 5th grade going home from school. One of the kids in the year below me decided once he get off the bus, that it would be a great idea to moon all the kids still on the bus. Pulled his pants down too far, and everyone got an eyefull of his junk, including the bus driver. He got in big trouble with the school and got teased for ages after that. __eou__
Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ I got my first action on a school bus coming back from a basketball game. It was a glorious evening. Everyone else was asleep, as we didn't even leave for home until midnight and it was a 2.5 hour drive. My new girlfriend and I sat in the back and went at it like our lives depended on it. __eou__
Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ I was in first grade and a group of high school boys at the back of the bus decided to recruit me to listen to music with them. They said they wanted me to grow up to like good music. They were surprised when I recognized Pantera and Metallica as "mom's house cleaning music." (I don't think their plan worked, I like some terrible songs) __eou__
Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ At the end of the year after 8th grade graduated, the 7th graders had to go to school for a few more days.

Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ When we stopped to pick up a 2nd and 3rd grader. As most kids that live in the country their parents had left them to get on the bus by themselves as they had to get to work. Well these kids had a new puppy. So no one was watching the puppy. Like all puppies it wanted to stick by its new owners at all times. It chased the kids onto the bus. The bus driver noticed the puppy and trying to be careful decided to drive off. We stopped shortly after leaving. Me being the oldest kid she called me to the front of the bus. She told me that she thinks that she ran over the puppy. She told me to go check. I was 12. I went outside and sure enough she had ran it's head over. It's eyes had popped out of its skull and was hanging by the nerves. Kind of like a fucked up cartoon when their eyes bug out. She had me move the dead puppy to the side of the road so no one else ran it over. All while the kids bawled their eyes out as their bus driver killed their new puppy. __eou__
Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ Leroy. High school. We named our bus driver Leroy. 1996. Before Leroy Jenkins. This ride or die mother f'r would not speak. He pulled up in his bus, opened the swing arm, glared at us, waited, closed the swing arm. Waited. Once we were seated he would drive. Not a word, ever. We drank, we smoked, we.. What finally broke him was a fight. Leroy pulled his bus over and got out of his seat. Standing In the aisle Leroy said "That's enough". The entire bus went silent. Leroy was the man. __eou__
Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ Some kid was messing around with an apperantly very sharp pencil and the bus hit a jump and she got some wicked air sending the pencil partly through her leg. __eou__
Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ Some kid in the back of the bus was being harassed by his bully. My school district didn't really do shit about bullies. The kid being bullied was sitting three to a seat with his legs in the aisle, and the bully was sitting by one of his friends, in the aisle across from the kid he was messing with. The bully decided to start pushing the kids leg. Before it was verbal, but now it was physical. Kid told bully to stop. Bully mocked him and did it again. Kid then punched the bully in the nose, breaking it and causing this huge amount of blood to leak from it. By now the bus has stopped at some bus stop. The kid gets his stuff and gets off at the bus stop that's a few ahead of his. The second he's off he starts running and going a different route to his house. The bus driver was unaware of what happened until someone yelled for the bus driver to call someone because the bully's nose wouldn't stop bleeding. So she calls someone while the bully is calling his mom crying. So we get the police to show up, his mom, other kids have called their parents because at this point we've been at a standstill for 30 + minutes, and the principal. We don't know who called the police. So they, along with the principal are asking who did it and to confess. And we are all like "we don't know" of course we did know but why would we tell on our hero? The principal and police are talking and they think the kid is still on the bus. We then say, "oh, he got off we don't know where he went or who he was" the principal and police look at the bus driver who shrugs because she didn't realize what was going on until it was too late. We spent two hours on that hot bus because of it but I couldn't even be mad. My middle school bus was wild. __eou__
Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ Had to teach a kid why sticking your middle finger up at someone is considered inappropriate and offensive because I was a patrol and was supposed to stop him from doing that. Unfortunately, I didn't know WHY it was offensive other than that it was, so I finally had to just tell him to ask his parents and not to do it in front of me ever again. Also I went home with my friend a couple of times and the year that the cicadas were out in full force, there was this one dude who rode on her bus who would collect money from people daring him to eat a cicada. He did this every day for like two weeks and by the end of it people would refuse to pay him. I think he just wanted to eat the cicadas but needed an excuse to do it. __eou__

Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ We had to make, "God's Eyes," in Spanish class. We unwound them and flew them like kites out of the back of the bus. Then we realized we could slowly unwind them to catch on trees and signs to "decorate" the town. Then we did it with a bunch of 8-tracks we found in a guy's garage. We called them streamers. We had "decorations" laid out over our bus route for months. Cars had to hang back behind us to not get hit with them when we slowed. No one ever said anything. Also the time we slid off road during a snowstorm and everyone just got off and walked home. That was fun. __eou__
Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ A bully stopped me from getting off the bus at my street; by blocking the way. I was at the back of the bus then. Also I was very small then, first year of school; so I can't compete yelling out to the bus driver in the middle of the kids hype fest. Finally the bus driver realised I was still in the bus after full lap and send me home afterwards. On the following year, I got a bike to ride to school which is awesome! __eou__

Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ I went to elementary school in the 1970s, and the school bus was apparently used by a bunch of rowdy highschoolers who were really into the whole drug culture. Usually the high school kids got bussed first, followed by junior high, followed by elementary school. So the by the time we were on the bus, we had all the fresh graffiti from the earlier morning. Some of the graffiti was very distractive. They used to cut strips of the vinyl seat off, and then glue them onto the back of the seat with sayings like, "bong hits," that cocaine snowflake star, and lots of pictures of crude cartoons of people in afros smoking fatties. There were also popular band logos of the time, the one I remember was that Led Zeppelin ZOSO thing, plus that looped figure 8 that everybody draws on their desks. We didn't have sharpies back then, so most of the kids drew all the crude stuff with ballpoint pen. Sometimes the school would tape the seats that they cut up with duct tape, so the kids would cut up the duct tape and use that. __eou__
Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ It was the late 70's, I think I was in 7th grade. Our bus driver was a very cool guy everyone called Animal. The bus was an old one with a stick shift and clutch. Last day of school, Animal drives the bus to a nearby park, and instructs all of us to the back of the bus. We all pile up in the last 3 or 4 rows of seats, and he revs the engine and pops the clutch. The guy was popping wheelies in a school bus. Rumor has it he was banging the girl's gym teacher too. Good times. __eou__

Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ Live in Buffalo street. Elementary school bus driver makes constant jokes about it to the point where I get upset and ask him to stop. He writes me up for distracting him while driving. Middle school. Had a silver winter jacket that I was very proud of because it was beautiful and shiny. Put my jacket on my seat, the kid who sits next to me starts stabbing it with a red pen. Punch him, he runs to the back of the bus, I beat him up, bus driver cheered me on. __eou__
Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ When I was in 6th grade I moved from a really small town where I could walk to school everyday, to a much larger one where I had to ride the bus. I was having trouble finding my way around the school the first week, and ended up running very very late to catch the bus at the end of the day. I was already beating myself up about the fact that I was going to have to call one my parents who would have to leave work early to pick me up, but when I got outside the bus was pulled right up to the doors waiting for me. The bus driver knew I had been on the bus that morning and verified with my brother that I was supposed to get on the bus to go home, so he waited. I know it seems really insignificant but, with all the stress and anxiety I was feeling trying to settle into a new house, new city, and a new school it made a lasting impression on me. Thank you Ron. __eou__

Redditors who rode the bus to and from school, what was your most memorable moment on the school bus? __eou__ My friends were doing bong hits in the backseat, and we went over a bump. Yeah. It fucking shattered, spilling nasty dank bongwater and broken glass everywhere. It was a mess. The bus driver was clueless as fuck, so we just left the mess on the bus and we never heard anything of it again. Good times. __eou__

Teachers of Reddit, after losing it with a student or punishing them unjustly, have you felt embarrassed or contrite. What is it like seeing that student again afterwards? __eou__ I am lucky enough to be a reflective person, and therefore aware of when I'd acted unjustly. In those instances, I actually used my free period, or the end of the day, to go find the student and chat. I'd let them know why I'd flipped out, and apologize for my actions. In the end, my relationship with those students always improved because of it. __eou__

Athists of Reddit, what do you believe made the Big Bang? __eou__ A thought I had, Based on the thesis that the universe is currently at a state of [accelerated expansion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space), and that in previous times the universe's rate of expansion was decelerating, my thought was that according to the state of entropy of 'all the stuff' making up the universe I.e matter, dark matter, neutrinos, photons etc. the universe expands &amp; contracts, meaning that at a particular timeframe the universe may have been shrinking due to lower universal entropy I.e high number of galaxy &amp; solar systems dying out in a non-violent manner, high number of red stars etc. thus causing for a lack of energy and dark energy in the universe allowing it to shrink. Like a [shrinking gas filled container](https://socratic.org/questions/how-does-entropy-change-with-pressure) By shrinking the universal system gets smaller gradually condensing the aforementioned 'stuff' within it creating a pressure of sorts thus adding to its entropy and allows for relative expansion once more. So the universe might be gradually expanding and contracting according to its inner entropy &amp; energy levels, when finally a situation arises where all entropy is gone and the universe condenses around a giant mass of all the matter ('stuff') it contains, causing for a Big Bang. __eou__

I'm 120 now. At 5'3". Everyone thinks I'm the bees knees on the surface. Why? I'm slim. Not skinny, by any means. But certainly when I was average, I did not turn any heads unless they were laughing at me. __eou__ 230 pounds is no where near average. your current size is average. __eou__ I got the impression we were talking about the American average, which for a woman is currently a size 16 at last tally? But yeah, I should be average. I rarely see women who are close to where I am or lower. __eou__ i was speaking in terms of general sizing, around sizes 4-10 __eou__ I dunno, the models certainly are toned but a lot of the ones I've seen lately don't have that particularly emaciated look going on, either. A toned body is more pleasing to the eye, and tall stature really helps with the visual display aspect of it all - they're on a budget and generally the fewer alterations you have to make and accommodate, the cheaper it is. Depending on whether it's high fashion or street fashion, slimmer models may be used to accentuate the actual structure of the garment as opposed to attempt anything close to a general consumer-fit product. It's art. And the models themselves aren't exactly strutting about in unattainable physical condition. __eou__
why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ Because God thinks it's fucking funny __eou__
why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ Women want to wear something that makes them look better than what they currently are. If you place an above average woman or an idolized woman in fashion, it will create demand for the item. __eou__ i am talking about size, not looks or fame. __eou__ Slim women are biologically more attractive, for one thing. For another, the designers save money on fabric. __eou__
why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ Because they're not skinny sized women. __eou__
why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ Who would want to look at that? __eou__ yes because shorter, healthier looking women is so horrendous __eou__ It's not I guess. I just am afraid you are going to swing to the other extreme __eou__ HAES. __eou__ Which is a horrible organization __eou__ Peering down that rabbit hole was what started me losing weight for good. I couldn't believe how aggressively deluded some of the practitioners are. __eou__ It's my biggest motivation too. Normally I tell myself "I'm not that big yet," but you know, they probably said that too at one point __eou__ I know that's something I told myself. Then one day I was barely able to button size 18 pants. And I was only 18 years old when most of the girls in my class were a size 2-6. __eou__

I just am afraid you are going to swing to the other extreme __eou__ Even if you don't agree, it's not difficult to see where OP is coming from - the average model is significantly taller and skinner than the average person. __eou__

why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ skinny and tall models show off the clothing better plus-sized models aren't average themselves either, they are tall and have flattering proportions. If an average woman weighed the same as one of those plus-sized model, she'd just be a blob of fat. the goal is to make the clothes look good, so people buy them thinking they'd look as good as the models. That's how modeling works. __eou__
why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ Because the AVERAGE sized American is overweight. __eou__ I was the only thin one at Walmart a couple weeks ago. Everyone else was no less than three of me __eou__ Wall-E, here we come __eou__ I saw a busted can of biscuits just left there by one of them and pointed it out to my boyfriend by saying "that's what everyone here looks like" __eou__ Except the biscuits actually have a use. __eou__ They did before they were ruined anyway. Now nobody wants them and it's gonna cost extra somewhere to dispose of them. __eou__
why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ Because the AVERAGE sized American is overweight. __eou__ i should have said general american sizing, about sizes 4-10. not the actual average size. __eou__ Except nowadays with all that alternative sizing, size 10 is prob overweight too :/ __eou__ it may be borderline, depending on body type. __eou__ Also, I would say that recently the more "average" sizes ARE being used. I have heard one reason for using slimmer models though also has to do with wearing multiple layers of clothes, also it being easier to change the appearance (shape) or clothes on a thinner model, because there is less to interfere. __eou__
why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ Because "average sized" in America means obese everywhere else. And what you consider "fashion sized" is the average woman everywhere else __eou__ Don't underestimate other Western countries though. The UK and Australia in particular have huge obesity problems, though maybe not *quite* as bad as America's (yet). __eou__

why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ I kinda get OP's point: why do average size women want to buy clothes they've seen on statuesque figures rather than those with similar body types? __eou__ [deleted] __eou__ no, i am a woman. however, the difference in the things you picked to challenge me on vs. fashion is that everyone wears clothes. of course not every woman is going to be a model, i just think that from a 5'2, 130 pound woman stand point it's extremely frustrating to see very tall, thin women or very tall, large women wearing clothes that designers expect me to buy. most of them i do buy because i am in the fashion industry and i just have to have most things i own hemmed or altered. __eou__ [deleted] __eou__
why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ In society in general, rarity is prized. If you view people as being on a bell curve in terms of size, there are more people in the middle (average) and the very thin and very large are on the outer ends. Different cultures prefer different ends of the curve, and ours happens to like the skinny side. So, those relatively rare, super skinny people are held to be closer to our "ideal" size. __eou__
why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ For the same reason average men aren't? Do you disagree? __eou__
why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ I don't know, but I'm using your post as an excuse to rant. I do know that they don't actually make those clothing for women! I cannot tell you how many times I have gotten psyched at seeing a very tall model in nice pants and I rush to buy them, only to find that they only come in like a 28 inch inseam and to get a 34 inch inseam I need like a size 16 or something (whatever that even means). I am not even a "freak" or anything. I'm 5'11'' and 140lbs (130 ish if I am at marathon running weight) and fuck all if I don't have to buy men's pants to actually have them fit right. Luckily for me with the hipster pants craze I get well crafted men's jeans with pockets that actually hold things instead of fucking fake women's pockets that are made for what, a lipstick? You can't even fit a tampon into the pocket of women's pants. Also men's pants have real sizing. I can buy a 34 inch inseam 27 inch waist and I know it will fit me, whereas after 32 years of being a woman, I have no idea what size I am in women's pants. It's different every time! So I don't give a flying fuck what women they use on their ad, if they don't have a variety of sizing and real pockets, they don't get my money. __eou__ That was the most satisfying rant I have ever read, you covered all the things that drive me nuts !! thanks __eou__
why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ Same reason average penis's (penii?) aren't idolized in porn. *outrage ensues* __eou__ the average penis still makes it into plenty of pornographic movies __eou__ *Idolized* __eou__

why aren't average sized women idolized in fashion? __eou__ Because most models are thin for a number of reasons, and plus size models model a different fashion line entirely and get some positive attention for breaking norms, but if you're size 4-10 you're SOL as far as representation goes. Too big to look like a regular model, too small to be plus size or get applause from people who are against thin models. OTOH, it's super easy to find clothes in the right size in most stores so even without overt attention, the stores apparently know what to carry. __eou__ "if you're size 4-10 you're SOL as far as representation goes. Too big to look like a regular model, too small to be plus size or get applause from people who are against thin models." yes! yes! yes! however, i do disagree with clothes being super easy to find because clothes are still usually designed based on taller women __eou__

What do you think about minimalism? __eou__ gud __eou__
What do you think about minimalism? __eou__ I believe that minimalism is a response to the excesses of consumerist culture. It embraces simplicity because of the belief that less is more. Essentially I think it is a good thing to incorporate into your everyday life because it helps you focus on the more important things by not wasting time accumulating stuff. __eou__
What do you think about minimalism? __eou__ meh __eou__
What do you think about minimalism? __eou__ Envious __eou__
What do you think about minimalism? __eou__ I like it. It simplifies our complicated lives. __eou__
What do you think about minimalism? __eou__ Very little... __eou__
What do you think about minimalism? __eou__ We become slaves to the things we own. The worst is a house. Consider every possession in terms of maintenance, lifespan, and replacement costs. The more you have, the higher they collectively cost to maintain, and the less time you have for everything else. I went from having a 5000 sq ft house full of stuff and eating all of my time to a two bedroom apartment. I can't express how freeing it is to have my weekends back - the last year I've spent most of the winter skiing, went scuba diving in the Philippines, and started fly fishing. Put your time and energy into those things that reward you - get rid of the excessive crap that binds you. __eou__
What do you think about minimalism? __eou__ Like others have pointed out, I think that the popularity of minimalism arose as a response to our culture's commercial obsession with "more" and "better"... but the way I see minimalism as a popular aesthetic movement is different than my view of the philosophy itself. In our culture we tend to glorify certain aesthetics, and over time, those aesthetics move further and further towards extremes. I would liken modern minimalism to today's super skinny models... back in the 60's "Twiggy" popularized a slender androgynous look, and today we see that aesthetic taken to an unhealthy extreme. Likewise, in every home design magazine, news feature and Pinterest page I see people obsessed with aesthetic minimalism - people wanting more "less-ness". Don't get me wrong. I appreciate the philosophy of purposeful minimalism. In my own life, I have taken the time to consider my possessions, and chose to own only a few high-quality things that work well. However, minimalism is a personal process. Aspiring to a particular aesthetic will never be a substitute to cutting excess clutter in your life, and taking the time to consider your own life and philosophy. __eou__ I have to agree. I think a lot of people who practice Minimalism do so for social prestige reasons as opposed to its original purpose. There is something cool and non-conformist about opposing consumerism. In some ways it has become mainstream and causes equal amounts of anxiety as the clutter extreme. People worry so much about whether or not something is truly minimalist both philosophically and aesthetically that they forgot to enjoy its actual purpose. __eou__

Hey Reddit, why do you use a virtual assistant? __eou__ I don't. __eou__ Helpful. __eou__
Hey Reddit, why do you use a virtual assistant? __eou__ Because she does what I ask every time, cheerfully, never resentful about being a timer or a light switch.

Redditors who turned their life around, how did you do it and what advice do you have for people? __eou__ Sometimes you just need a change of scenery. If you're in a place that's making you feel depressed/hopeless, then just get out. It might feel impossible or too difficult to do at first, but once you make the first step you'll feel a whole lot better. __eou__
Redditors who turned their life around, how did you do it and what advice do you have for people? __eou__ Completely start over. Leave all your friends, move somewhere else, and start again. If your life is thoroughly messed up, you need a do over. When I was young I was stealing, dealing drugs, living on couches and sometimes in places I wish I didn't have to remember. Because of my lifestyle I went to prison and when I got out, started over. No contact with anyone I knew before. Became really choosy about friends. Made each step intentional and was careful about it. When I went to prison when I was in my early 20's. I am now 47. Once I got out I never went back. Today I oversee global software development efforts and have a great family and friends. Never underestimate the power of a do over. __eou__

Veterans of Reddit who have seen combat, what don't the movies get? [Serious] __eou__ Shoot man, where do I begin? - You cannot hear each other during an intense firefight. In movies, they yell at each other while bullets are flying and explosions are happening. No. In firefights, all you hear is a buckle and then a relentless pinging sound. Sign language and prior training is fundamental. - Confirmed kills are not a thing unless you're an elite operative (Special Forces, Navy SEALs, etc). I was a conventional artillery soldier and we used confirmed kills for the sake of filling out battle damage assessment forms after fights, but it's not like in the movies where you shoot someone and yell "KILL CONFIRMED TANGO DOWN!" There's no record of your kill count. - Grenades in movies tend to take a while to explode. From the time you pull the pin, you've got about 3 seconds until it explodes. Because of this, you absolutely should NOT volley a grenade like they do in the movies. You should aim to aggressively beam it to get it as close as possible to the enemy. I can't remember the numbers off the top of my head, but an M68 fragmentation grenade has a kill radius of 5 meters and a blast radius of 15 meters. I'm really not sure about those numbers, but they should be close. - Bullets. Omfg. Guns in movies seem to have endless rounds in their magazines. For the US military, the standard rifle is the M4 Carbine and the M16A2. Each standard magazine holds 30 rounds and you are given 7 of them, so you only have 210 rounds on your kit. You can pack more if you get a bandoleer or something, but standard is 7 mags. - Speaking of bullets, automatic fire. Automatic fire on a rifle is worthless. Not only can it compromise accuracy with its rapid recoil, but remember that I said that each M16A2/M4 magazine holds 30 rounds. You know how long a magazine lasts in an automatic M4 if you hold the trigger down? About 5 seconds. Also, you're not supposed to hold the trigger down with any kind of automatic weapon (except for the VERY rare cases where you just really need to lay down suppressive fire that badly). Automatic weapons are supposed to be fired in short bursts. Prolonged rapid fire is not only inaccurate, but it'll overheat the weapon, risking damage. Barrels on automatic weapons are supposed to be changed out every few hundred rounds for just this reason. EDIT: - Oh another big one. Movies and the media make it seem like deployed soldiers are constantly in combat. Not true. Even at the most dangerous outposts, you're shooting or getting shot at usually less than 5% of the time and firefights usually last several minutes at most (just like fist fights). The Taliban especially have a penchant for hit-and-run guerilla tactics, popshots, etc. The other 95% of the time, you're baking in the sun and doing mundane, repetitive tasks such as cleaning weapons, filling sandbags, doing vehicle maintenance (PMCS), cleaning something, playing cards, etc. __eou__ Awesome post. Out of curiosity what would you say was the usual distance you would engage a target with small arms? __eou__ As far as possible, honestly. You've been trained to shoot. They haven't. The farther away you are from them, the less likely they are to be able to get a shot on you. The Army standard for marksmanship distance is 300 meters while the Marines' standard is 500 meters. But I'd say the sweet spot would be around 150-200 meters. Most service members can hit targets at those distances with relative ease. I wasn't the greatest shot with a rifle. At the range, I struggled with 300 meter targets, but I could hit 150 meter and 200 meter targets in such quick succession that I'd make a semi-automatic rifle sound almost like an automatic. But I was my squad's SAW gunner anyway, so it didn't matter. I mostly delivered suppressive fire and barraged choke points. __eou__ Very informative, Thanks! __eou__

I was a conventional artillery soldier and we used confirmed kills for the sake of filling out battle damage assessment forms after fights, but it's not like in the movies where you shoot someone and yell "KILL CONFIRMED TANGO DOWN!" There's no record of your kill count. - Grenades in movies tend to take a while to explode. From the time you pull the pin, you've got about 3 seconds until it explodes. Because of this, you absolutely should NOT volley a grenade like they do in the movies. You should aim to aggressively beam it to get it as close as possible to the enemy. I can't remember the numbers off the top of my head, but an M68 fragmentation grenade has a kill radius of 5 meters and a blast radius of 15 meters. I'm really not sure about those numbers, but they should be close. - Bullets. Omfg. Guns in movies seem to have endless rounds in their magazines. For the US military, the standard rifle is the M4 Carbine and the M16A2. Each standard magazine holds 30 rounds and you are given 7 of them, so you only have 210 rounds on your kit. You can pack more if you get a bandoleer or something, but standard is 7 mags. - Speaking of bullets, automatic fire. Automatic fire on a rifle is worthless. Not only can it compromise accuracy with its rapid recoil, but remember that I said that each M16A2/M4 magazine holds 30 rounds. You know how long a magazine lasts in an automatic M4 if you hold the trigger down? About 5 seconds. Also, you're not supposed to hold the trigger down with any kind of automatic weapon (except for the VERY rare cases where you just really need to lay down suppressive fire that badly). Automatic weapons are supposed to be fired in short bursts. Prolonged rapid fire is not only inaccurate, but it'll overheat the weapon, risking damage. Barrels on automatic weapons are supposed to be changed out every few hundred rounds for just this reason. EDIT: - Oh another big one. Movies and the media make it seem like deployed soldiers are constantly in combat. Not true. Even at the most dangerous outposts, you're shooting or getting shot at usually less than 5% of the time and firefights usually last several minutes at most (just like fist fights). The Taliban especially have a penchant for hit-and-run guerilla tactics, popshots, etc. The other 95% of the time, you're baking in the sun and doing mundane, repetitive tasks such as cleaning weapons, filling sandbags, doing vehicle maintenance (PMCS), cleaning something, playing cards, etc. __eou__ Awesome post. Out of curiosity what would you say was the usual distance you would engage a target with small arms? __eou__ As far as possible, honestly. You've been trained to shoot. They haven't. The farther away you are from them, the less likely they are to be able to get a shot on you. The Army standard for marksmanship distance is 300 meters while the Marines' standard is 500 meters. But I'd say the sweet spot would be around 150-200 meters. Most service members can hit targets at those distances with relative ease. I wasn't the greatest shot with a rifle. At the range, I struggled with 300 meter targets, but I could hit 150 meter and 200 meter targets in such quick succession that I'd make a semi-automatic rifle sound almost like an automatic. But I was my squad's SAW gunner anyway, so it didn't matter. I mostly delivered suppressive fire and barraged choke points. __eou__ That's actually closer than it seems in the movies - and closer to gunfire than I would want to be! Respect! Thanks for your service - and reply (fascinating!) __eou__

People of reddit, how did you cope with the stress of school? [SERIOUS] __eou__ My first semester of my university I didn't work. GPA went to shit as I had too much time to just party and do whatever. When I ran out of cash, I started working. It kept me focused and on task. I equate my better grades and such on working more and just staying organized. Oh, and bang whores...just don't get attached. __eou__
People of reddit, how did you cope with the stress of school? [SERIOUS] __eou__ High school or college? More importantly, what's stressful about school? __eou__ University right now. Basically everythings stressful, the hour and a half commute, the pointless courses i have no interest in, midterms and exams worth more than half the course. __eou__ So you're me, basically. I have a 90 minute commute too. First year I guess? Make friends to share the burden. I made an arrangement last week to share a room with a friend, and keep my extra baggage there. You might want to talk to a counselor, if the service is free. Get rid of any emotional baggage/vent frustrations that you may be carrying. Reach out and look for help if you need it. __eou__

He said he accidently sat on it after getting out of the shower. __eou__ I'm sure it was an "accident". I'm sure he would "accidentally" sit on another one if he told the truth. __eou__
What is the weirdest thing you have witnessed at the doctor's office? __eou__ This person confusing a google search with thousands of hours of studying and treating patients. It was so weird how they knew more than the doctor __eou__ Almost anyone in the medical realm probably has to deal with this to one degree or another. Knowledge can definitely be power; a little knowledge can be dangerous. Many times people don't know what they don't know or understand. This is especially true in general population in regards to medicine. __eou__
What is the weirdest thing you have witnessed at the doctor's office? __eou__ This is more depressing than weird. All the doctors were gathered around, talking about this one patient. Apparently, he recently cut himself and needed a tetanus shot, but could not afford it. They said that they couldn't just give a free shot. I had to leave after this, though. __eou__

In the US, there are a limited number of years for drug companies to recoup the cost of researching 10 drugs and maybe getting 1 to market.

Why is trolling hypersensitive people on social media so much fun and addicting? __eou__ [deleted] __eou__
Why is trolling hypersensitive people on social media so much fun and addicting? __eou__ For me personally and others with a certain syndrome similar to the one I experience, it's the duping delight. It's a win/win really though. I mean, I get a kick out of the theatrical aspect of having successfully pretended to hold views (or faked a certain personality) that I do not in reality posses, to the point where I've earned an emotional reaction from the target. Meanwhile, they get the attention and comfort from their peers that they so desperately lack and crave. Both parties win. __eou__
Why is trolling hypersensitive people on social media so much fun and addicting? __eou__ When I was in the military I discovered an related phenomenon. Everyone eats shit, everyone gets their turn, life isn't fair, we all know that. When anyone new came into our shop, the more you fight getting shit, the more you will get, I guarantee it. __eou__
Who was the worst co-worker you have ever had? __eou__ A drug addicted paranoid emotional mess who looked to me for constant support while working overseas away from his family and friends.

Who was the worst co-worker you have ever had? __eou__ This one bitch I worked with used to always act like she was better than everyone. She would look down her nose at us and treat us like we were inferior. Funny thing was she was on the same part time level as I was, she had no power what so ever. But for some reason she would target me for most of her hate. She would blame me for things I didn't do and talk about how I don't know how to do my job to patrons and co-workers. She would just be rude and nasty toward me. I would be busy doing work at the desk and she would just walk off leaving me to deal with checking out books to all the patrons(I work at a library). Finally one day when she was barking out orders at me I got fed up with her shit. I said "Seriously!?! Why are you such a bitch!?! What made you so bitter? What can I do to make you stop being so rude?" She looked and me and said, "I could use about Tree-Fiddy" Now this was around the time I realized that my co-worker of 4 years was in fact a 20 story tall 2 ton reptilian from the Paleolithic Era. I shouted "DAMMIT LOCH NESS MONSTER! You Have A Job! I ain't giving you no damn $3.50!!!!" __eou__

Do you have a dog? What's the story behind getting it? Can you post a picture? __eou__ http://imgur.com/gLEqlqW My wife and I got a dog about 3 years ago. She was a rescue at a kill shelter. When we went to go look she was so scared and stand offish. Everything scared her like she had been abused or something. We decided on her and as we are getting her someone brings in a stray dog to take her place. She was next up on the kill list when we got her. We drove a semi so we were kind of worried about her getting in the truck and dealing with how loud it can be. When we got to our truck she jumped right in no problem and went straight for a cubby we had a bed in for her. She came out for food and water but other than that she stayed away from us as much as possible for 3 days. After 3 days she started warming up to us and jumped in the bed and never went back to her cubby. She is an amazing dog that is so different from that scared little thing we picked up. __eou__

[Serious] What is a good question to start/keep a conversation? __eou__ I try to listen to the news for as much as I can bare without turning blue. Usually, I just start talking about any late news that might be interesting to them. __eou__
[Serious] What is a good question to start/keep a conversation? __eou__ A good one is "tell me how you got into your current career" or "what do you like to do for fun" and keep following that trail. People like talking about themselves and their passions. __eou__
[Serious] What is a good question to start/keep a conversation? __eou__ Personally speaking, about the only thing that can instantly get me engaged in a conversation is being asked about my pets. That obviously doesn't work for everybody, but it doesn't hurt to try. __eou__
Ar what point did having to sleep on the couch after a disagreement with your SO become not so bad with netflix and kitchen access and all? __eou__ The point in your relationship where you'd rather just ignore each other than deal with each other? __eou__
Ar what point did having to sleep on the couch after a disagreement with your SO become not so bad with netflix and kitchen access and all? __eou__ I mean, you can watch Netflix whenever you want, and the kitchen stays open 24/7. If you and your SO aren't getting along enough to share a room, that's a problem. If Netflix and food are a good substitute for your SO, you've got an even bigger problem. __eou__
Ar what point did having to sleep on the couch after a disagreement with your SO become not so bad with netflix and kitchen access and all? __eou__ None of it is cool, times are weird, not exciting weird, just stale. Feel like I have to do what I never wanted to do and mainly pissed by how I have to do it. "Not like this" __eou__

Trump haters and Trudeau lovers, why do you attack people who disagree with you so strongly? __eou__ What does the first clause of your sentence have to do with the second? Remember from middle school English how clauses were supposed to have some sort of logical connection?

Lucid dreamers of Reddit, how did you train yourself to lucid dream? __eou__ I would recommend /r/luciddreaming __eou__
Lucid dreamers of Reddit, how did you train yourself to lucid dream? __eou__ I am starting to get the hang of it, it's such a strange event __eou__ What's your preferred method? I'm just now experimenting with WILD __eou__ I honestly don't have one, I have had some very scary sleep paralysis moments and I usually lucid dream if I wake up early morning and force myself to doze back off or when I have a nap during the day, wake up briefly then fall into a lucid dream, now I am starting to get the hang of it and try let myself go along with it, it is intimating though! __eou__ That's basically the WILD method, close enough at least. Sleep paralysis can be quite frightening. One time I couldn't get up for school in the morning and I was very frightened. __eou__ Have you experienced the "weird body of pressure " on you? I did a couple of times and had to fight myself to wake up thinking someone/thing was on top of me, absolutely horrible! __eou__ I have not. Could you tell me more about this? __eou__ Not a lot to tell if I am honest, don't know a lot as to why it happens but the third time it happened I managed to calm myself down and wake up easier and quicker , you just can't move but you are "awake" and aware of what felt like a heavy body on me stopping me from moving at all, not even a finger, I was groggily looking around in the dark though, I repeat, not pleasant ! __eou__ Interesting. Good luck with your future dreaming endeavours __eou__ And to you! __eou__
Lucid dreamers of Reddit, how did you train yourself to lucid dream? __eou__ My lucid dreams are completely different from other dream types. So I just naturally figured out that I had control over most of that dream world, first clue was that I could think in the dream. In my.other dream styles that isn't a thing. If I'm not having a lucid dream there is nothing I can do yo make it lucid, it's like watching a movie. __eou__
Lucid dreamers of Reddit, how did you train yourself to lucid dream? __eou__ I had my first lucid dream about 2 or 3 months ago. It took a lot of practice for me personally. I induced my dream simply through reality checks. I'd recommend doing reality checks throughout your day and keeping a dream journal. Write in it as soon as you wake up. If you dont remember your dream the previous night, simply write, I didn't remember my dreams last night. Best of luck to you. There's nothing quite like it! __eou__
Lucid dreamers of Reddit, how did you train yourself to lucid dream? __eou__ I didn't. And I still can't find a "trick" to it. Plus lucid dreaming is a spectrum of control. Total control is the best, obviously, but you also get to make choices within the frame of the already chosen story sometimes, too. __eou__
Lucid dreamers of Reddit, how did you train yourself to lucid dream? __eou__ I had a serious problem with nightmares so I started reading up on lucid dreaming. Taught myself and now I can get myself out scary happenings . Just takes a lot of trying. __eou__
Lucid dreamers of Reddit, how did you train yourself to lucid dream? __eou__ Check out /r/luciddreaming What you wanna do first when you start is start a dream journal, you want to remember your dreams! Every night go to sleep with the intention to remember your dreams. In the morning or whenever you wake up at night, don't move, just focus on trying to remember what you just dreamt about. Then write this down, even if you don't remember anything, just write "no dreams remembered" or whatever. eventually you'll be able to remember your dreams way more than you ever could. As well as keeping a dream journal you should also do daily reality checks! For example looking down at your hands and counting how any fingers you have, in a dream your hand would be distorted and in a dream you would have more or less fingers then usual. When you're doing them you need to remember to actually question reality and ask yourself if you are dreaming or not. Don't do them mindlessly like I did otherwise they won't work when it happens in your dreams, this is what happened to me. Eventually if you remember and do them consistently, you will start to do them in your dreams and you'll recognize youre dreaming. After a while of remembering dreams, you could also start to note down repetitive themes or objects/items that appear in your dreams - dream signs. When you notice these, you should remember to do reality checks and ask yourself if you're dreaming etc. Eventually you can move on different methods when you're more experienced such as WILD - wake initiated lucid dreaming, there are a shit ton of different techniques you can try. Your first lucid dream could come at any time. For some people it takes months, for some people a few days. This is a big topic with a bunch of information to research, just remember the most important thing is to keep a dream journal and remembering your dreams - because if you had a lucid dream you won't remember it. Many many people don't remember their dreams. Just stay relaxed and don't stress if a lucid dream doesn't come your way, this will hinder the process, happy dreaming! __eou__
Lucid dreamers of Reddit, how did you train yourself to lucid dream? __eou__ A few different things. One was that I had vivid nightmares as a kid, so at some point I would close or open my eyes during the dream to either wake myself up (opening my eyes) or to change the dream (closing my eyes) Another, and this probably happened before the one I mentioned, was awareness of my body during the dream. I used to pee the bed as a kid, so I just made a decision to stop peeing the bed. I'd sit at my bed and tell myself "I'm going to do this during the dream, I'm going to wake up at this time etc etc" So I would actually start to dream about it. I'd be trying to find a toilet and not being able to relieve myself. That was the sign I had to wake up and go to the bathroom. I already had good dream recall before all this, &amp; have always been sort of back of my mind aware during the dream that I'm dreaming, even when I can't control it. So I'm not sure how that works for other people. __eou__ When I was a kid, I hated pissing in a bathroom and being like ahhhh then realize you went in your pants Actually, now that I think about it, I would be seriously creeped if I pissed my pants in a dream and then they weren't soiled when I woke up the next morning. __eou__ I didn't ever pee in the dream. I'd realise I needed to pee, and go find a bathroom and when I tried to use it I couldn't for whatever reason. Then after a few frustrating dream moments I'd realise I actually needed to pee irl and wake myself up. __eou__
Lucid dreamers of Reddit, how did you train yourself to lucid dream? __eou__ I tried to intentionally induce lucid dreaming using a variety of techniques such as habitual reality checks and setting alarms in the middle of the night; nothing worked. Three months after that experiment, when I had already long given up, I had maybe 5 lucid dreams over the span of three weeks (albeit around 30 seconds each). Training never directly worked for me, but perhaps it sparked the opening of some subconscious gateway. __eou__

Reddit, what is the actual best free anti-virus program? __eou__ I use Malwarebytes and stay away from sketchy websites. Works pretty well so far. __eou__
Reddit, what is the actual best free anti-virus program? __eou__ I recently switched to BitDefender. It's bare bones, uses almost no resources, and blocks malware and adware as well as viruses. __eou__
Reddit, what is the actual best free anti-virus program? __eou__ 1st place : Common sense 2nd place : Avast! Free. 3rd place : Malwarebytes (as complementary anti-malware to avast). I never have any problem with virus since these 3... __eou__ &gt; 2nd place : Avast! Free. Avast got too bloated for me in their last few updates. __eou__ I'm all ears for a better alternative. I'm already confused by their new UI and it sometimes won't stop shoving promotions of paid services. But it does its job and I don't know any other good, free, and easy to use antivirus. __eou__ BitDefender works well so far :) __eou__ Thanks, gonna try it __eou__ Make sure you uninstall avast properly :) __eou__

Reddit, what is the actual best free anti-virus program? __eou__ Malwarebyters and Avast imo __eou__
Reddit, what is the actual best free anti-virus program? __eou__ Avira. There are a few firms that conduct tests yearly, and Avira has one of the top scores consistently. [Here's one test done.](https://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/avc_fdt_201603_en.pdf) Malwarebytes' free scanner is also great, but not an active antivirus. __eou__ I've heard some weird shit about Avira, something about not being able to detect a certain virus. I got avast. __eou__ I'm not a fan of Avast's GUI, but I'm sure it's also acceptable. Its missed rate was only 0.5% higher than Avira's. __eou__

Friends on Reddit, what is your life after death theories? If any? __eou__ I am open to the idea of alternate or parallel dimensions.

Maybe someone can fill me in or tell me how people make doors open and close on their own and shit like that. __eou__ Same! I have a silly theory that keeps me sane, we all live until we get old and die naturally but for example I had a bad car crash so I believe I am dead in some parallel universe where my friends and family mourn me there or when I had meningitis in this dimension I died in another from it, or if I lose someone in this dimension they are still living happily in another of there own dimension, after we die of old age I have no fantasy ideas though, I know it's silly but hey , who knows, it keeps me happy ! __eou__

What is the worst cooking fuck up you have ever had? __eou__ My sister burned her house down trying to make donuts __eou__
What is the worst cooking fuck up you have ever had? __eou__ Cookies. Forgot to keep an eye on them in the school cooking area, in which I took them out and were completely charred. I still ate them, regardless. __eou__ Of course you did, they're fuckin cookies __eou__ Well, I weren't going to throw them away, was I? To be fair, despite being incinerated, they didn't taste too bad. Just need a drink afterward, since I was dehydrated. __eou__
What is the worst cooking fuck up you have ever had? __eou__ I thought you were supposed to put the popcorn in the microwave with the plastic still on. I learned in 10 short seconds that plastic on is not the way to go __eou__

What is the worst cooking fuck up you have ever had? __eou__ Was making curry on a gas stove I wasn't used to. Turned the heat down too fast and lost the flames altogether. I gassed out the house for an hour before realizing the sauce wasn't changing temperature. Almost killed three people __eou__
What is the worst cooking fuck up you have ever had? __eou__ Put some water on the stove to make ramen, went out to watch TV while I waited for it to boil, my friend called and asked me to come over, I left and forgot it was on the stove. Thankfully my mothers boyfriend came home before I burned the house down but I did burn the fuck out of the pan. He totally saved my ass and threw the pan away and went out and got a new one. __eou__

What is the worst cooking fuck up you have ever had? __eou__ To quote the late, great Mitch Hedberg. "I like baked potatoes, but they take too long to cook. So I'll put one in the oven, because by the time it's done, who knows, maybe I'll want one". Tried that approach and forgot about it, went to bed, woke up next morning to the putrid smell of a potato briquette. __eou__

What is the worst cooking fuck up you have ever had? __eou__ Decided to make a delicious quiche. Promptly forgot it was in the oven until I happened through the kitchen and almost had a heart attack.

Woke up the next morning to find a slightly burnt quiche waiting for me in the kitchen. __eou__
What is the worst cooking fuck up you have ever had? __eou__ A group in my foods 1 class made french toast but didn't put any sugar or anything on it so it was just bread dipped in egg yolk. This one dude ate it but he cried the whole time. __eou__

Feminists/those with similar views: what are some examples of the patriarchy that still needs dismantling? __eou__ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia#Mobility &gt; Saudi Arabia has no written ban on women driving, but Saudi law requires citizens to use a locally issued license while in the country. Such licenses are not issued to women, thus making it effectively illegal for women to drive. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia#Hijab_and_dress_code &gt; A hijab is a traditional Islamic norm whereby women are required "to draw their outer garments around them (when they go out or are among men)" and dress in a modest manner.[59] Saudi Arabia is different from many Islamic societies in the extent of the covering that it considers Islamically correct hijab (everything except the hands and eyes) and the fact that covering is enforced by Mutaween or religious police. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topfreedom#California &gt; Supreme Court of Florida held that a separate statute about disorderly conduct can be used to prosecute female toplessness __eou__ Interesting, thanks! __eou__ You are welcome. __eou__

What's your workplaces version of "X is fine, just don't do it when the inspector is here"? __eou__ Not my current job but my last job on the first day I was straight up told "Everybody here uses the forklifts, but if OSHA walks in we don't know anything." I avoided using them for a few weeks but one part of my job involved collecting tons of plastic wrap off the floor and it was 1000x easier to just scoop it up with a forklift. We also enjoyed doing donuts on the forklifts while somebody hung off the side and ramming eachother with the giant mountains of plastic wrap. Also the warehouse was so big that everybody hid in the stacks and smoked weed. It was not a safe workplace. __eou__

What hobby starts off cheap but sneakily becomes expensive as you get more into it? __eou__ Shooting.. Getting started depends on your definition of cheap.. You can get a 22 bolt action for around 100 to 150 on up, then you get another gun to try out, then hey! skeet shooting.. Time to buy a shotgun.. Then you learn about 3 gun and get a semi auto rifle and pistol... Ammo is a bitch... Currently saving up to build an AR before all the liberal douchebags get them taken away... __eou__ Dude you gotta get into reloading your ammo. At first you will save money, but then you'll just use your same budget you used to spend on ammo to make 4X as much as you used to buy... __eou__

What hobby starts off cheap but sneakily becomes expensive as you get more into it? __eou__ Playing (probably?) any instrument. My student violin was $300, and I upgraded after a few years to a serviceable one for $1000. Now the next upgrade is basically $5000-1000. It's crazy how the next appreciable step-up in quality comes with such a huge cost increase. __eou__ As a drummer, I couldn't agree more. One cymbal? $200, at least. And don't forget the $60 stand. Time to change heads? Alright, that's at least $50 per- and each drum needs two. I wish I could have been more passionate about a less- expensive/cumbersome instrument, but I love it and wouldn't have things any other way. Edit: Forgot to mention that if you're playing frequently, each of those heads need to be changed out every few weeks to several months (depending on which drum, and which side of each drum). __eou__

Personally I know comic books do; you start out thinking "I'm only going to collect this specific title", then that becomes "okay, I'm only going to collect anything related to these characters", then the crossovers start, and suddenly you're collecting every title that brand makes, and you're still curious about the rival brand and all those little guy brands because you know any of those books could be the next "Spawn" or "The Walking Dead".... __eou__

Flat-Earthers of Reddit, what's your most compelling piece of evidence? __eou__ I've read about it and listened to some stuff.

Among those are terrestrial aliens and the hollow earth. __eou__ Wait I thought Antarctica was the wall of ice that surrounds the flat earth so the water doesn't fall off. __eou__ Yeah. That's why we aren't allowed to go there and why planes fly in such weird directions around the poles. __eou__

Flat-Earthers of Reddit, what's your most compelling piece of evidence? __eou__ The evidence for a flat earth is derived from many different facets of science and philosophy. The simplest is by relying on ones own senses to discern the true nature of the world around us. The world looks flat, the bottoms of clouds are flat, the movement of the sun; these are all examples of your senses telling you that we do not live on a spherical heliocentric world. This is using what's called an empiricist approach, or an approach that relies on information from your senses. Alternatively, when using Descartes' method of Cartesian doubt to skeptically view the world around us, one quickly finds that the notion of a spherical world is the theory which has the burden of proof and not flat earth theory.  Perhaps the best example of flat earth proof is the Bedford Level Experiment. In short, this was an experiment preformed many times on a six-mile stretch of water that proved the surface of the water to be flat. It did not conform to the curvature of the earth that round earth proponents teach.  Many other experiments demonstrating the lack of curvature in the earth may be found in ''Earth Not a Globe'', by Samuel Rowbotham. __eou__ You sound like you're actually serious. How would you propose gravity would even work with a flat Earth? Let alone the fact that you can observe different stars in the night sky from different places on Earth. __eou__

Flat-Earthers of Reddit, what's your most compelling piece of evidence? __eou__ Really round earth theory is a conspiracy of the liberal media. All the scientific research showing that the earth is clearly a flat triangular object is just being supressed. Also, one time, I fell off the edge. __eou__
Flat-Earthers of Reddit, what's your most compelling piece of evidence? __eou__ I took [this](https://i.imgur.com/EGOgkna.png) picture yesterday. Ignore that there's not a southern hemisphere. The southern hemisphere is a myth. I'm not actually a flat-Earther. __eou__

If the cops detain and handcuff someone that requires sign language to communicate, would that constitue a violation of freedom of speech?

If the cops detain and handcuff someone that requires sign language to communicate, would that constitue a violation of freedom of speech? And depending on the answer, why? __eou__ All I'm imagining is a deaf black American* guy getting handcuffed &amp; read his rights during which he starts waving his tongue back &amp; forth with some minor spittage in a scared attempt to communicate his lack of understanding, getting beat in the back of the head for resisting arrest &amp; attempted assault on an officer, then tased relentlessly by multiple officers as he attempts to steady himself again * let's be real, only Americans are capable of such racist stupidity in a developed country which supports free speech.

If the cops detain and handcuff someone that requires sign language to communicate, would that constitue a violation of freedom of speech?

As far as I know, it doesn't violate freedom of speech. __eou__
If the cops detain and handcuff someone that requires sign language to communicate, would that constitue a violation of freedom of speech?

If the cops detain and handcuff someone that requires sign language to communicate, would that constitue a violation of freedom of speech? And depending on the answer, why? __eou__ No. You can be arrested and read your rights at a later date when somebody is present to read them to you. __eou__
